========,2,Club career.
========,3,Liverpool and loan spells.
Gayle was born in Toxteth and brought up in Norris Green.
He joined the youth ranks at local side Liverpool in 1974.
He signed a professional contract with the club in 1977 becoming the first black player to play for Liverpool which was seen as a 'victory' for the black community in Liverpool as Gayle explains.
Possibly his finest hour for Liverpool was the 61 minutes he played in the 1980–81 European Cup semi-final second leg away at Bayern Munich.
He was rewarded with a winner's medal at the end of that season as a non-playing substitute in the final.
This led to his autobiography being titled, "61 Minutes In Munich".
After loan spells at Fulham and Newcastle United, Gayle left Liverpool after making just five appearances.
========,3,Birmingham City.
He joined Birmingham City where he played in the 1982–83 season scoring once against West Ham.
He then hit 10 in 45 during the 1983–84 campaign.
========,3,Sunderland.
Gayle then signed for Len Ashurst's Sunderland.
He became a popular player playing in two seasons before moving overseas.
========,3,Blackburn Rovers.
He then spent five years at Blackburn Rovers, signing for them in 1987 and being a regular striker in their quest for top flight football.
However, by the time Blackburn were promoted in 1992 (to the newly created Premier League), Gayle had been left behind in the pecking order by expensively signed new players like Mike Newell and David Speedie, and with the arrival of national record signing Alan Shearer that summer, it was clear that Blackburn manager Kenny Dalglish felt that Gayle was surplus to requirements at Ewood Park.
========,3,Halifax Town.
Gayle joined Halifax Town in the newly renamed Division Three but managed just five league appearances as they were relegated to the Football Conference.
After leaving Halifax he had a brief trial at Carlisle United, before retiring from football.
