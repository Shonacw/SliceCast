========,1,preface.
Burke & Wills is a 1985 Australian adventure film directed by Graeme Clifford, starring Jack Thompson and Nigel Havers.
The film is based on the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition across Australia.
The film follows Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills in their crossing of Australia's interior in 1860-1.
The film's account of the story changes the expedition's ending by having the explorers actually reach the northern coast.
This upbeat idea was vehemently criticised by Australian reviewers.
The story was also filmed the same year as a comedy, "Wills & Burke".
========,2,Production.
Graeme Clifford was an Australian who had become a leading editor in Hollywood and had moved into directing.
He was interested in making a film about the Burke and Wills expedition and in 1978 approached EMI Films, who had commissioned a script from Terence Rattigan based on the story.
This did not work out so Clifford then hired a fellow Australian expatriate, Michael Thomas, to write a screenplay.
Early financial assistance was provided by David Williams of Greater Union.
Clifford then went to make his first feature, "Frances" and discovered that Greater Union's enthusiasm for the movie had cooled.
However, he received support from Hoyts-Edgley who agreed to finance.
The budget would be particularly high because of Clifford's insistence at filming along the actual path of the expedition.
Charlton Heston was once interested in playing Burke but Clifford says he only ever envisioned Jack Thompson in that role.
After seeing "Chariots of Fire", he wanted Nigel Havers to play Wills, a decision opposed by Actors Equity, but this was overturned at arbitration.
Filming started in September 1984 and took 13 weeks.
Many of the original locations were used, such as Coopers Creek, because Clifford thought it was important to be as authentic as possible.
Additional filming was completed in England some months later.
Painter Sidney Nolan came out on set and was the film's official painter.
========,2,Film release.
The film premiered in Melbourne on 2 November 1985 before Prince Charles and Lady Diana; the first Australian Royal Premiere.
It opened in other Australian cities on 7 November 1985, was shown at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival in May, the Toronto Film Festival in September 1986 and was released worldwide in early 1986.
"Burke & Wills" performed disappointingly, grossing $1,567,000 at the box office in Australia, (which is equivalent to $3,729,460 in 2009 dollars).
Jonathan Chissick later said "people in Australia were just not interested in seeing a picture about these two guys dying in the desert."
The movie was released in the US but also performed disappointingly there.
========,2,DVD release.
The movie was released on DVD in 2014 through Umbrella Entertainment.
Although released in Australia on the PAL format, the disc is region free.
Umbrella Entertainment used the re-mastered version of the film produced by the National Film and Sound Archive (Australia) as part of the sesquicentenary activities in 2010; the sound was left as 2-speaker stereo.
The DVD has no menu on the disc and the movie is presented in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format.
