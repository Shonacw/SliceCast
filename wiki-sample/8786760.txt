========,1,preface.
James Edward Slattery (born August 25, 1904 in Buffalo, New York, died August 30, 1960) was a professional boxer in the light heavyweight (175 lb) division.

========,2,Professional career.
========,3,World light heavyweight champion.
Slattery, son of a Buffalo fire fighter, turned pro in 1921 and came up short in his challenge for the World Light Heavyweight Title against Paul Berlenbach in 1925.
His KO loss in 1925 to Dave Shade was named Ring Magazine Upset of the Year.
Slattery won the vacant NBA light heavyweight title in August 1927 with a decision over Maxie Rosenbloom, only to lose it to Tommy Loughran in December of that year.
He won the NYSAC World Light Heavyweight Title by beating Lou Scozza on February 10, 1930.
Slattery lost the title later that year in a bout against Maxie Rosenbloom for the NYSAC World Light Heavyweight Title and the Undisputed World Light Heavyweight Title.
The verdict was "highly unpopular" with the 15,000 fans at the fight.
The United Press score sheet gave Rosenbloom 8 rounds and Slattery 4, with 3 even.
Referee Patsy Haley, after being almost knocked out by one of Rosenbloom's wild swings, gave his decision to Slattery.
He was overruled by two judges, both of whom voted for Rosenbloom.
========,2,Death and legacy.
Alcoholism almost certainly shortened Slattery's life, career and marriage (he had famously eloped with 19-year-old Elizabeth A. Pendergast).
During the Great Depression, Slattery was known to throw money out of the window of his car while driving through the streets in order to help the poor children buy new shoes for school.
A play about Slattery's life, "Jimmytown", written by Anthony Cardinale, was produced in Buffalo in 1997; Jimmy Slattery Place, in South Buffalo, was named in his honor in 2006.
A diagnosis of tuberculosis significantly impacted his health during the last decades of his life.
Slattery died of pulmonary tuberculosis on August 30, 1960, in Buffalo, New York, USA.
His former wife, Elizabeth Ann Burgess (n√©e Pendergast) died in 1998.
