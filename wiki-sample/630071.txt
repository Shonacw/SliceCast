Yukon is the only federal electoral district in Yukon, Canada.
It has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1902 to 1949 and since 1953.
The City of Whitehorse comprises an overwhelmingly large portion of the electorate and thus elections are fought on a comparatively small area.
========,2,History.
The electoral district was created in 1901 with the obligation that Yukon send a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons by January 1, 1903.
James Hamilton Ross, the Yukon's third Commissioner, was elected on December 2, 1902.
The riding was abolished in 1947, and the riding of Yukonâ€”Mackenzie River was created including a portion of the Northwest Territories.
In 1952, Yukon-Mackenzie River was abolished, and the riding of Yukon was recreated.
This riding did not change as a result of the 2012 redistribution.
