========,2,Sports.
========,3,Football.
The Sandalwood Saints compete in the Gateway Conference in Jacksonville, Florida.
They also compete in District 1-8A of The Florida High School Athletic Association(FHSAA).
Class 8A is the largest of the FHSAA divisions and regarded as one of the toughest in the nation.
One of the first major high schools on Jacksonville's rapidly growing south side, Sandalwood experienced tremendous growth throughout the 70's and 80's.
They were the first Jacksonville area team to compete in the State's largest high school football district, moving up from class 4A to 6A in just under a decade.
From 1989-1999, Sandalwood competed in the 2-6A district which consisted of six teams(Tallahassee Lincoln, Lake City Columbia, Mandarin, Orange Park,Tallahassee Leon).
This district alignment was the largest in Florida at the time, and highly regarded as one of the toughest high school divisions in Florida.
The Saints were known for their stingy 4-4 defense and ball control Wing-T offense.
While structured within this district format, Sandalwood teams had to travel three hours for some district games including contests against Tallahassee Leon High School and Lincoln High School (Tallahassee, Florida) and Lake City Columbia High School.
In an attempt to create equal competition amongst top tier schools, the FHSAA replaced Tallahassee Leon with St. Augustine High School in 1997.
They also realigned teams in district 2-6A by looping Jacksonville's 6A schools into a district with Orlando schools in 2000.
Yet these realignments were met with complaints from coaches of both Jacksonville and Orlando Schools about the continued long travel distances for district games.
After further discussions, the FHSAA in 2003 realigned Sandalwood into a two-team district (1-6A) with Orange Park High School.
This again created much controversy throughout the state due to the current playoff format granting post season berths to district champions and runners-ups.
With this format Sandalwood was granted playoff berths regardless of their record in 2003 and 2004.
Finally, to silence the decade long controversy amongst North Florida 6A High School teams, the 1-6A district was formed in 2005 possessing four Jacksonville area schools to compete for two playoff spots.
In 2011 Sandalwood entered the newly created 1-8A district, the largest in Florida.
It meant a return to the crowded six team districts which the school competed in throughout the 1990s.
Regardless of district alignment, Sandalwood has proven its ability to adapt and remain one of the top football programs in Florida.
The new era of Sandalwood football features a spread offense, one much different than the Wing-T of days past.
But this hasn't stopped the recipe for winning as Sandalwood possesses a winning record in 14 of the last 16 seasons.
They currently have 23 FHSAA playoff appearances with 12 wins and 11 losses.
Updated (07/2011) Noteworthy season In 1995, The Sandalwood Saints varsity football team went 14-1, losing in the Class 6A Championship Game to Miami Northwestern High School 12-7.
The Saints were led by a tenacious defense and the "USA Today Florida Player of the Year" and "Florida's Mr. Football" running back Frankie Franklin.
Franklin was injured in the regional playoff semifinals and was limited in playoff action.
The Saints were ranked No.
4 in the National USA Today Prep rankings that year before losing in the state championship game.
