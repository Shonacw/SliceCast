========,1,preface.
Stephen John Kalinich (born in Endicott, New York, United States) is an American poet mostly known for his collaborations with the American band the Beach Boys.
He is also known for his 1969 album "A World of Peace Must Come", which was a collaboration between him and Beach Boy bandleader Brian Wilson.
The album remained unreleased until 2008.
========,2,Biography.
Kalinich drifted from the East Coast to California in the mid-1960s, transferring from New York's Harpur College (now Binghamton University) to UCLA.
Immersing himself in the anti-war movement, he began working the LA scene as a poet and performer, appearing at venues such as The Troubadour (Los Angeles).
At an early age, he began writing poems and articles about World Peace.
He has said, "Very early I wanted to be an influence for peace and good in the world."
An album, "Leaves of Grass", co-written with Kalinich's early collaborator Mark Buckingham, was recorded in 1966 but radio stations would not play it, wrongly assuming it was about marijuana.
At the time, Kalinich was studying and working at a gas station.
As the hippie movement snowballed, the Doors and Love were exposing the dark underbelly of the 1960s dream.
Kalinich's poetry rests on that pivot point.
