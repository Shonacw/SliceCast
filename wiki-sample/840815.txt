(His Labour colleague Thomas Macpherson was elected in Romford in 1945, but lost the seat to the Conservative John Lockwood in 1950).
Parker was briefly a junior minister from 1945 to 1946, serving as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Dominions Office, with James Callaghan as his Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS).
He lost this position as a result of the strong views he held on South Africa.
He remained a backbencher afterwards, serving on several Parliamentary committees, including the Procedure Committee from 1966 to 1973.
His private member's bill introduced in 1952 to repeal the Sunday Observance Act 1780 was rejected; however, another private member's bill of his became the Legitimacy Act 1959, dealing with the legitimacy of children from void marriages and that of children whose parents married after the birth.
He also shepherded a ten minute rule bill into law, the British Nationality (No 2) Act 1964, which implemented into British law the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.
He remained MP for Dagenham until he retired at the 1983 general election.
He was the last serving MP to have been elected before the Second World War, and he was the Father of the House of Commons from 1979 to 1983; he was succeeded in this position by his former PPS, Callaghan.
Parker was associated with the Fabian Society throughout his political career.
