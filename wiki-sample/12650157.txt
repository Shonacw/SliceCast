USS Formoe (DE-509) was a "John C. Butler"-class destroyer escort acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II.
The primary purpose of the destroyer escort was to escort and protect ships in convoy, in addition to other tasks as assigned, such as patrol or radar picket.
Post-war she proudly returned home with two battle stars to her credit.
"Formoe" (DE-509) was named in honor of Clarence Melvin Formoe, born 25 January 1909 in Seattle, Washington.
Formoe served in the Naval Reserve from 25 November 1930, on active duty after 1 July 1941.
While serving in the Air Scouting Force at the Naval Air Station, Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Aviation Machinist's Mate First Class Formoe was killed in action during the Japanese attack of 7 December 1941.
He was posthumously commended for his efforts to repel the attack in utter disregard of his own safety.

"Formoe" arrived at Manus from the U.S. East Coast 15 January 1945, and ten days later sailed for Morotai to join a troop convoy bound with reinforcements for Lingayen.
She entered Lingayen Gulf 10 February, and for the next month and a half operated in the Philippines, guarding minecraft and exploding the mines they swept in Baler Bay and Casiguran Sound, and sailing as escort from Lingayen to Leyte.
From 21 to 30 March, "Formoe" patrolled off Panay in a picket line covering landings there, then continued her Philippine escort duty, making one voyage to Manus to bring landing craft north.
The escort departed Subic Bay 18 April 1945 to stage at Morotai for the invasion of Borneo.
She arrived at Tarakan 1 May escorting the amphibious force, and from 3 to 30 May off Borneo, acting as headquarters ship for Captain Charles Gray, the officer commanding all naval activities at Tarakan.
In addition to driving off several Japanese air attacks, she fired in four separate shore bombardments to support the troops advancing ashore.
Between 2 June and the close of the war, "Formoe" ranged widely on escort duty, calling at Leyte, Hollandia, Ulithi, Manila, and Okinawa.
At Manila at the close of hostilities, she began occupation duty with a return voyage to Okinawa, then served as escort for the flagship of Fleet Air Wing 1 for most of the remainder of her career, calling at Shanghai and Hong Kong, as well as in Tokyo Bay.
