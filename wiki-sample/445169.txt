The first single "I'm Not Missing You" was released in August 2006.
The second single, "So Simple", is the last single from her third album which never charted in the US.
========,2,Early life.
Orrico was born in Seattle, Washington to Patti (née Schmautz) and Dean Orrico.
She is of Italian descent, born to a close Italian-American family.
The family later moved to Denver, Colorado, where Stacie took piano lessons from Cathy Paquette.
Orrico is the middle child of five: her siblings are Jesse, Rachel, Alicia, and Joshua.
Both parents loved to travel, requiring the family to move frequently.
She grew up influenced by a wide range of musical styles and was a member in the church choir; she often accompanied on the piano as the family sang Christian hymns.
At age 6, Orrico wrote her first song, entitled "Always Answer".
========,2,Music career.
========,3,1998–2001: Beginning with pop career.
Orrico got her start in 1998, at the age of 12, by attending a Christian music festival, Praise in the Rockies, held in her then-home state of Colorado.
Orrico inadvertently entered a high-stakes talent competition, and won.
A ForeFront Records executive was on hand and approached her for a record deal.
She later signed with them.
In 2001, she toured with Destiny's Child on their "Survivor" US tour.
Since then, she has released two albums.
The first was "Genuine" (2000), which she recorded at age 14.
It sold over 13,000 copies in the first week, the highest debut week sales ever for a female Christian artist.
The album produced the hit single "Don't Look At Me" which topped Christian charts for ten consecutive weeks.
The album had two #1 hits, as well as three more Top Ten singles.
"Genuine" eventually sold 500,000 copies, giving the album "Gold" certification on word-of-mouth alone.
In 2001, 15-year-old Stacie released her only Christmas album, "Christmas Wish".
The 6 tracks were: "Christmas Wish," "Love Came Down," "O Holy Night," "What Child is This," "O Come All Ye Faithful," and "White Christmas."
========,3,2002–04: International success with "Stacie Orrico".
Her next effort, the more mainstream and self-titled album "Stacie Orrico", was released in 2003 and charted on the US "Billboard" 200 (debuting at number 67), Australian ARIAnet and the UK Albums Chart.
The first mainstream single from this album was "Stuck", which became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 5 on the majority of the world's charts.
This was followed by the single "(There's Gotta Be) More to Life", which peaked in the Top 20 in Australia (#11) and the UK (#12), although, overall, "Stuck" charted better, the exception being in the US.
This was then followed by "I Promise", written by and Stacie Orrico (top 30 in the UK), and the final mainstream single "I Could Be the One" (top 40 in the UK on June 2004).
Both singles were given limited releases and limited promotion, meaning they did not fare as well as the first two singles.
The last three singles were only released to Christian radio in addition to "Strong Enough", which reached #1 as the CD's very first single.
"Stacie Orrico" sold over 500,000 copies in the US, enough sales for a Gold certification.
The album also sold 600,000 in Japan and an estimated 3.4 million copies worldwide.
In 2004, Orrico's songs "(There's Gotta Be) More to Life" and "Stuck" appeared on the "Barbie Hit Mix".
She was nominated in 2004 for the first time at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in the category "Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album", but the award was given to Michael W. Smith.
========,3,2005–07: "Beautiful Awakening".
After her break, she decided to work on her new album, called "Beautiful Awakening", which was set to be released worldwide on August 29, 2006; however, for reasons unknown, the release of the album was postponed in the US.
In an interview, she said that the album was one of the best albums she has worked on and was a personal album; the songs are about her life and more.
Though almost all of the songs from the new album leaked onto the internet, "Beautiful Awakening" was still released in Japan, the UK, and other countries.
The album features production from Dallas Austin, Dwayne Bastiany, KayGee, and The Underdogs, and writing duties are performed by notable songwriters like She'kspere, Track & Field, Anthony Dent, Nate Butler and newcomer Novel and Orrico herself.
The album sold 100,000 copies in Japan.
The first single, "I'm Not Missing You", went for radio adds on June 20, 2006, but due to little promotion was re-released in October.
The song peaked at #19 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.
The second single from the album, "So Simple," was released in Asia in October 2006 and was released in Europe on January 27, 2007.
The album release in the US and Canada was canceled and Orrico has no sign of an official US release.
"Beautiful Awakening" is available to purchase on iTunes.
In 2007, the belated release of "Beautiful Awakening" was postponed once again.
In March, Orrico announced that Virgin Records was merging with Capitol Records and she had left them and would not be releasing the album with that label.
Her record company terminated their contract with Stacie and her tour dates were called off.
On her Myspace it was announced that she would spend time in Africa.
========,3,2008–12: Hiatus.

In 2009, she was back in the studio with Brandon Beal and Cannon Mapp to record her upcoming fourth album.
One of the tracks she recorded was 'Light Years' which should appear on her next album.
Later the song did not make the album and was re-recorded by Albanian-American artist Kristine Elezaj in 2010.
In 2010, she co-wrote a song with Novel for American Idol-winner and R&B-singer Fantasia Barrino called "I Can't Be Without You" for her third studio album "Back to Me".
Unfortunately the song did not make the final album.
Rumor has it that Orrico would retire from the music business, but her longtime-collaborator Novel confirmed in 2010 that Orrico is still writing music and in 2011, her friend Rachael Lampa also confirmed Orrico's musical return.
In 2012, she featured on The Fray's third studio album Scars and Stories on the track "Ready or Not", which is a cover The Fugees.
The song is only available on the deluxe edition bonus disc of the album.
She independently released a new song called "Catch Me If You Can" on April 2, 2012.
"Catch Me If You Can" is composed and performed by Orrico and The Gabe Cummins Orchestra, which has a jazzy sound.
