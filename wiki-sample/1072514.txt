The Tamagotchi Connection (UK: Tamagotchi Connexion) is a virtual pet in the Tamagotchi line of digital toys from Bandai.
The Tamagotchi Connection is unique from prior models in that it uses infra-red technology to connect and interact with other devices and was first released in 2004, 8 years after the first Tamagotchi toy.
Using the device's infra-red port, the virtual pet (referred to as a Tamagotchi) can make friends with other Tamagotchis, in addition to playing games, giving and receiving presents and having a baby.
Versions 1 to 4 of Tamagotchi Connection have 6 levels of friendship that can be viewed in the Friends List:

Versions 5 and 6 have different levels.
If the Tamagotchi cannot find a partner from another device to have babies with, a matchmaker will come, allowing the Tamagotchi to have a baby with a computer-controlled Tamagotchi character.
This applies to versions 1 to 4 and 6 only.
Version 5 introduces a Dating Show game in which the user must play to gain a CPU partner.

The Tamagotchi Connection makes additional changes to gameplay instead of simply changing the games and other minor details.
For example, the child and teenager can go to school and play mini-games, where an adult can get a job.
Also, the "Lamp" menu item (allows the user to turn the "light" on or off) is no longer present.
Instead, it is replaced with a "Mail" menu item where the player can check for any mail they will occasionally receive.
New to the Tamagotchi Connection with the v4 is the ability for a child or teenager Tamagotchi to go to school and an adult to go to work.
The player can choose which teacher they want once the Tamagotchi reaches the Teenage stage, and will train either "Funny Points", "Gorgeous Points" and "Spiritual Points" through mini-games.
The player also chooses what job an adult Tamagotchi gets and will unlock mini-games based on this choice.

========,3,Tamagotchi Connection v5 Familitchi (2008).
The Tamagotchi Connection v5 is the English version of the FamiTama and is the first Tamagotchi to be exactly the same (besides language) worldwide since the Tamagotchi Plus.
It was released in Asia on January 6, 2008 in Australia on January 10, 2008 and was released worldwide later in February of 2008.
The v5 introduces the ability to raise families, with 3-5 parents and kids.
It also has a new website that it shares with the Famitama, the "Tama and Earth Expo".
According to the package, "The Tamagotchis set up this expo to learn more about Earth."
It contains a central pavilion and 4 other pavilions representing each of the main areas of the Earth.
It also included a TV option where the player can use Gotchi Points to shop on the Shopping Channel, find a mate with the Dating Show, or go travelling on the Travelling Show which replaces the pause function of previous generations.
There is a design flaw with the v5 which prevents it from properly connecting to the other Tamagotchis in the series.
