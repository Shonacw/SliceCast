========,2,Plot.
Four men stand holding what appears to be a blanket, while one wearing a hat stands watching.
A sixth man then runs towards them and attempts to jump into the blanket.
He attempts this unsuccessfully twice in a row failing to jump high enough.
On the third attempt he is able to jump and spin in the air, nearly clearing in the blanket.
The man who are holding it then flip it a little in the air causing him to fall to the ground.
His fourth attempt is more successful and he is able to roll on the blanket and land on his feet at the other side.
He runs around for a fifth and final attempt but this is less successful and he gets stuck in the blanket and has difficulty getting out despite the attempts by the four men to throw him free.
