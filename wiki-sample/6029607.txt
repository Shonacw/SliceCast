========,1,preface.
The Puerto Rico Police ()also known in Puerto Rico as "La Uniformada" ()is the state police of Puerto Rico.
The Puerto Rico Police is also one of two investigative arms of many of Puerto Rico municipal police forces, the other one being the Puerto Rico Special Investigations Bureau of the Puerto Rico Department of Justice.
The Police is organized into thirteen regions within Puerto Rico for operational purposes with headquarters are 601 Franklin D. Roosevelt Avenue in San Juan.
========,2,History.
========,3,Origins.
The Puerto Rico Police traces its history back to 1837, when Spanish governor Francisco Javier de Moreda y Prieto created "La Guardia Civil de Puerto Rico" (Puerto Rico Civil Guard) to protect the lives and property of Puerto Ricans, who at the time were Spanish subjects.
It provided police services to the entire island, although many municipalities maintained their own police force.
Since invading and taking possession of Puerto Rico in July 1898, as a result of the Spanish–American War, the United States has controlled the island as a US territory.
The "Insular Police of Puerto Rico" was created on February 21, 1899, under the command of Colonel Frank Thacher (US Marine officer during the Spanish–American War), with an authorized strength of 313 sworn officers.
========,3,Quasi-military.
In 1980, in accordance to Law 26 of 1974, it was described as "a quasi-military" organization of public safety, later to be changed by the "Puerto Rico Police Act" (Act No.
53) of as a "Civil Organization" of public safety as those on the US mainland.
In 1993, governor Pedro Roselló created a new plan to fight back crime called "Mano Dura Contra el Crimen" (or "Strong Hand Against Crime") in which Puerto Rico Police officers were assisted by the Puerto Rico National Guard in everything that involves police work, except police investigations.
They were better known because of the raids that they made in housing complexes or "Caseríos" with rapid force and precision and also, the use of military vehicles and tactics.
This program was put to the test from 1993 to 1996, but unfortunately, 48 police officers died in the line of duty.
It was later activated again in 2004 by governor Sila María Calderón but not with the same intensity as in the early 1990s.
========,3,Reorganization.
In 2009, Police Superintendent José Figueroa Sancha re-organized the Puerto Rico Police in terms of commanding officers and regional organization.
Every police zone was changed to have two commanding officers: one in charge of the field operations, and the other in charge of investigations.
Also, the name was changed from "Police Zones" to "Police Regions".
Also, a new policy of the agency was to get involved in the community.
Officers must get out of their patrol cars and sometimes patrol on foot in neighborhoods, so they can talk to citizens and socialize, as well identify the problems that exist in the neighborhood.
In September 2009, the government of Puerto Rico suffered an economic crisis, which caused the dismissal of thousands of public employees.
Many citizens' concern was that the dismissals of public employees would cause the level of criminal incidents to increase.
Governor Luis Fortuño dismissed this concern.
But in the last 3 months of the year 2009, crime increased dramatically, leading to the lists murders, commercial and house burglaries, and carjackings.
The year 2009 ended with a total of 894 murders, that would be 74 murders more than those reported in 2008.
The year 2010 began with a rise in type 1 crimes (murder robberies, carjackings), leading the murder by family feuds and those related to the transfer of drugs and illegal weapons.
In the first 14 days of 2010, there were 30 murders reported, an average of 15 per week.
Because of this alarming crime wave, the Superintendent of police, José Figueroa Sancha met with his colonels, commanders and chiefs of the 13 police regions and specialized divisions to create a new anti-crime plan.
As of 2009, the PRPD has over 18,222 officers.
========,2,Rank structure.
The Police Superintendent is the top commanding officer.
He is one of five "head of government agencies" appointed by the governor of Puerto Rico.
He leads the department and makes the orders to the agency, and also instructs the commanding officers for field operations.
Since 1899, police chiefs in Puerto Rico were appointed by the United States Government.
Selecting the police chief was originally a responsibility of the commanding officer of the United States Army in Puerto Rico, who also served as the governor until 1900, when the Foraker Act was established.
Afterwards, police chiefs were named by the U.S.
Appointed Governor of Puerto Rico and the Chief of Police could serve in that position for not more than 4 years.
Law #77 converted the Puerto Rico Insular Police into the Puerto Rico Police Department on June 22, 1956.
This converted the department from a quasi-military organization into a civil police force.
The Chief of Police position was replaced by a Superintendent.
Since then, the police superintendent has been named by the Governor of Puerto Rico.
The "Associate Superintendent" is the second in command.
He follows every order from the superintendent, including if the superintendent cannot do some specific things that the second in command can do.
Also, in case of sickness, disability or death, the Associate Superintendent assumes the position of Superintendent.
The "Auxiliary Superintendent of Field Operations" is in charge of every activity in the Puerto Rico Police Department that is related with the protection of life and property, maintaining law and order, the protection of civil rights and crime prevention, almost as a 2nd in command.
He plans, coordinates, leads and controls all the operational actions on the prevention service phase with the integration of citizens in a common effort and meet the training-educational aspect of children and to prevent youth crime, in line with guidelines issued by the Superintendent.
Also, he applies the public policy on rescuing the affected communities by groups linked to drug trafficking that took control of the perimeters of the public and private housing projects.
========,2,Divisions and bureaus.
========,3,Criminal Investigation Corps.
Formed in the early 1970s, this unit has been in charge of investigating crimes in Puerto Rico.
Its agents are mostly veteran officers, or young officers who recently graduated from the academy.
All 13 police regions in Puerto Rico have this bureau.
Most of its cases have been from robberies and homicides.
The bureau's divisions include:
***LIST***.
========,3,Drugs Division.
The Drugs Division is an elite unit that takes the fight to the enemy's doorstep.
These officers impact the places where drug dealers sell the narcotics, called "Drug Points".
In this hostile and dangerous environment, officers have been frequently attacked by drug point shooters, making it the highest risk unit of the Puerto Rico Police Department.
This division is also a Vice Unit that also attacks prostitution, illegal weapons and other special cases.
========,3,Highway Patrol Bureau.
The Highway Patrol Bureau is divided into three divisions: the Radar and Alcohol Detection Unit, the Expressway Patrol Unit, and the Metro Rail Unit.
The first two divisions share the same primary objectives of preventing and investigating traffic accidents, arresting drunk drivers, arresting street racers and confiscating vehicles used for street racing.
The Metro Rail Unit specifically protects the San Juan Metropolitan Area Rail System, or "Tren Urbano" in Spanish.
========,3,Joint Forces of Rapid Action.
The Joint Forces of Rapid Action (FURA) is a bureau that coordinates and leads all strategies to fight the trafficking of drugs, narcotics, illegal weapons and illegal aliens.
Specialized divisions within the bureau include: Air Support, Divers, Rescue, S.W.A.T., K-9 and Horseback units.
The Bureau also coordinates with US federal agencies to fight crime.
========,3,Motorized Impact Unit.
The Motorized Impact Unit is a subdivided unit that comes from the Traffic Bureau and the Tactical Operations Unit.
Deployed on motorcycles with the blue uniform and D.O.T.
patch, unit members are easily identified.
They are the first on the scene of a riot, taking control of the situation until the main D.O.T.
squads arrive.
========,3,Robbery and Bank Fraud Division.
Organized in 1982, this division investigates robbery and fraud attempts committed against companies dedicated to the storage or custody of money or valuables.
The division also coordinates the Amber Alert system and investigates all kidnappings.
========,3,Security and Protection Office.
This unit is the Dignitary Protective Services Division of the Puerto Rico Police Department.
They have been charged with protecting the Governor of Puerto Rico and his family, the Secretary of State, the Police Superintendent, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House.
Additionally, they protect the Resident Commissioner, Puerto Rico's only representative in the U.S. Congress, as well as other visiting government dignitaries, U.S. and foreign.
They have also been charged with investigating individuals who apply for security guard licenses on the island, as well as certain individuals requesting a concealed carry permit.
O.S.P.
officers dress in plain clothes, usually dark suits, and wear a small gold circular lapel pin.
If studied closely, it can be seen that this pin is the agent's badge.
Uniformed agents are also assigned to the office.
These agents have been mostly assigned to motorcycle units, and as advance agents.
Of all the Police units in Puerto Rico, this unit has been possibly the most elite in the force.
Agents assigned to it have been trusted with the protection of the most important government officials on the island.
Thus, most of the agents on the unit came from SWAT, Tactical Operations, Criminal Investigations Corps (CIC), Homicide Detectives and the best of the PRPD Highway Patrol.
========,3,Tactical Operations Division.
The Tactical Operations Division (TOD) commonly called "Fuerza de Choque" () is a well-known unit within the Puerto Rico Police.
Its "hands-on" tactics for crowd control, the unit's primary mission, have been infamous among Puerto Ricans, most noticeably where physical control of large gatherings people is necessary to prevent disorder or to restore order.
"Fuerza de Choque"s historic manner in dealing with crowd-control situations throughout its years of service has earned it criticism and complaints about civil-rights violations.
Litigation and legislation during the past years has brought improvements to the division's control techniques, reducing complaints and injuries, while improving its public image.
Title 42 of the United States Code (Section 14141), prohibits law enforcement officers from depriving individuals of rights protected by U.S. law.
Members of the D.O.T.
are selected, from the main police force, based on their reputation of being hard-working, tolerant and patient officers, not easily provoked or over-zealous.
Besides having the leadership traits of a model, modern police officer, Fuerza-de-Choque candidates must meet the minimum height requirement of or be talented in martial arts or another form of self-defense.
Besides crowd and riot control duties, "Fuerza de Choque" officers perform search and rescue, disaster and directed patrol operations.
Its membership may be found within the ranks of the regular police force (patrol/investigations) as well as in full-time SWAT teams.
Many citizens of Puerto Rico have been aware of the unit's "heavy-handed" reputation.
The mere presence of a platoon of "Fuerza de Choque"’s impressively fit officers wearing black berets, sharp uniforms and "spit-shined" boots is cause for a melting pot of feelings; admiration and respect as well as apprehension and distrust.
Nevertheless, "Fuerza de Choque"’s mission of crowd control has been the same throughout its service history, and it could be loosely characterized as successful; therefore, the unit remains an important resource to police field commanders throughout the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
========,2,Resources.
========,3,Air support.
The Aerial Services of the Puerto Rico Police Department are operated by F.U.R.A.
known in Spanish as "Fuerzas Unidas de Rapida Accion" (Joint Forces of Rapid Action).
Its mission is to identify, intercept, detain and seize ships or boats with their crews, whose intention is to promote drug trafficking, weapons smuggling or human trafficking.
It also provides air support to the ground units.
The aerial services unit dates back to 1963, when the air unit was stationed at Isla Grande Airport.
Its fleet at that time consisted of Fairchild Hiller FH-1100 and OH-23 Raven helicopters.
In 1986, the unit was integrated to form the FURA.
The fleet was changed to MBB/Kawasaki BK 117, MD 500 and Bell 206 helicopters.
The BK117s were "state of the art" in equipment for police patrol missions; one of the helicopters had weather radar and full IFR capability.
The Puerto Rico police became one of the first air units in the U.S. to operate a large BK117 fleet on police missions.
The BK117 helicopters are no longer in use, and most were auctioned off in recent years.
On December 31, 1986, a fire occurred at the Dupont Plaza Hotel.
People fled to the roof of the hotel to escape the fire, which had started in the hotel's casino.
The PR Police air unit responded with the MD 500 series helicopter, unit N5231G.
Lt. Julio Colón, the pilot, landed the helicopter on the roof of the 17-floor hotel, with just one skid in contact.
Space limitations of the roof structure prevented a more stable contact with both skids.
On mid 1990s, the air unit received one MD 520N NOTAR system, tail number N128PD.
Also, one Beechcraft Super King Air, from the program High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.
This aircraft has the same equipment as United States Customs Service aircraft.
The primary mission is monitoring of drug trafficking.
Today, the King Air is "not airworthy".
On July 26, 1993, was a sad day for the Puerto Rico Police air unit.
The MD Helicopters MD 500 N126PD "S/N 0499E", was on patrol when he collided with a cable wire with fatal consequences.
The accident occurred when the helicopter struck a high-voltage wire, not having reached the necessary height to avoid hitting them.
The helicopter caught fire instantly and the remains landed near some gates of Carraízo Dam in Trujillo Alto.
Every time when opening the floodgates of the Loiza river, a helicopter had flown over the place warning to fishermen to evacate the area.
Today this type of flight is prohibited.
Helicopter crew:
***LIST***.
In 1995 the Puerto Rico Air Unit received, five Bell OH-58 Kiowa from U.S. Army Donation.
The OH-58C are Demilitarized ("demilitarized" means converted to non-military use or purpose, returned to a civilian field.)
Today, this fleet of OH-58C is "Not Airworthy".
In 2000, the air unit received three brand-new helicopters, Bell 407 tail number N137PD and N311DJ, one Bell 412 tail number N136PD.
The Bell 412 was equipped "multi-mission" with rescue cable.
In 2006, FURA received two new Bell 407 tail number N139PD and N138PD helicopters with new Wescam technology, including more powerful searchlights and heat-seeking monitors that it can use to search for a person under any obstacle; also, it received a telephoto camera that can see a license plate very clearly from in the air.
The system are capable of transmitting live image to ground units.
In 2007, police superintendent Pedro Toledo, had plans to buy a blimp for use in the fight against drug trafficking.
Purchase never materialized because of the high cost of maintenance.
On December 2008, the air unit lost a Cessna 172 on the west side of the island.
They were on patrol, looking for suspicious vessel approaching the coast; suddenly the engine shut down.
They were forced to make an emergency landing on the shores of Añasco.
Three crew escape uninjured.
Today the Puerto Rico police dept.
fleet consists of 3 bell 429, 3 bell 407(one of them GX) and a Baron twin engine airplane.
***LIST***.
The Aereal Services duties range from giving air support to ground units and coastal patrol, to Search and Rescue and SWAT exercises.
========,3,Communications.
The Communications Division consists of four sections: 1.
Trunking systems and Microwave, 2.
Special Services, 3.
Telephone, and Radio Workshop.
Each region of enforcement has people from these sections providing the department with communication support.
The Puerto Rico Police radio communications are on VHF, UHF and 800 MHz.
The metro area is covered by two Motorola 800 MHz trunked radio systems.
The system is Motorola Type II since 1992.
This system covers the regions of:
San Juan, Bayamón, Caguas and Carolina.
Trunked radio system was upgraded to Motorola Smart Zone in 2010.
There is also systems interoperability, capable of communication in VHF, UHF, 700 MHz, 800 MHz and P-25 on the VHF, UHF, 700 MHz, 800 MHz.
Also, the Ponce and Mayagüez area runs a trunk 800 MHz analog system.
The rest of the island has been covered by VHF and UHF analog repeaters, since the 1950s.
Also with more disaggregated data and communications centers as follows: 13 control centers, one in each Region Police, a Command Center in Fura and Radio Control Center that is responsible for monitoring all Regions and Units of the Police of Puerto Rico And coordinates internal and external resources.
Puerto Rico Police use the Ten-code on police radio communication.
========,3,Ground transportation.
During its early years, the PRPD used horses, Harley Davidson motorcycles and Jeeps to patrol downtown and tourism areas.
Horses were also used to patrol mountainous areas.
In 1955 the fleet consisted of motorcycles, Volkswagen Beetles, and military jeeps.
In the mid-1960s, Governor Roberto Sánchez Vilella changed the fleet to the Plymouth Fury.
By 1985, the ground patrol fleet consisted of the Plymouth Gran Fury, Ford LTD Crown Victoria and confiscated vehicles, converted into either marked or unmarked police vehicles, until the late 1980s.
During the administration of Pedro Rosselló, the fleet switched to the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.
Other vehicles in the new fleet included the Jeep Cherokee, Mitsubishi Montero and Chevrolet Caprice.
Patrol cars have had several different color schemes.
They were originally painted dark blue, with white on the front doors and top ("see image at right)", showing the department logo on the front doors.
A blue, rotating code-3 light bar was mounted on the roof.
Unmarked vehicles used a single rotating light inside the car.
In 1998, the vehicles and colors of the patrol car fleet changed.
The new fleet consisted of the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, Mitsubishi Montero, Chevrolet Camaro, Ford Mustang, Honda Police CB500P, Harley Davidson Electra Glide, Ford Excursion and Ford Expedition (these last two only for SWAT).
The new color scheme was a white base all over the car, with two color lines, blue and yellow crossed, running along the side ("see image below").
From the rear of the car to its midpoint, the blue line ran above the yellow line.
At the midpoint, the blue line crossed behind the yellow line, placing the blue line below the yellow line from there to the front tire.
The logo was on the front doors.
"Emergencia 9-1-1" (Emergency 9-1-1) was marked on each side at the rear of the car.
Vehicle unit numbers were placed near the front door, just over the edge of the front tires on both sides; also on the roof, behind the light bar.
Governor Sila M. Calderon integrated the Ford Explorer and the Ford Taurus into the fleet in 2003, replacing the Mitsubishi Montero and Jeep Cherokee, although specialized units continued using some of these older models.
The Ford Mustang replaced the Chevrolet Camaro and the Honda Shadow motorcycle replaced Honda Police CB500P motorcycle.
Harley Davidson Electra Glide motorcycles remained in service, but were assigned only to veteran motorcycle patrol officers and the governor's escort.
This was also when LED light bars were introduced to the fleet, on the Chevrolet Impala cars assigned only to the Public Residential Security Corps.
A minor change in the paint scheme in 2003 was applied only to Highway Patrol vehicles; the blue line continued over the yellow line from rear to front, without intersecting, but with a curve toward the front door.
Search lights were mounted on each side of the light bar on the roof, and also on the front sides.
The PRPD logo was placed on the left side of the front door, rather than being centered on the door, while the highway patrol logo was centered on the rear doors.
A newer model of the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor jointed the fleet in 2008, along with the Chevrolet Trailblazer.
A new paint job was applied a month after the new vehicles arrived, but it affected only the Ford Crown Victoria cars.
The new design started with a white base color, then yellow was painted on the first half down on each side, dark blue was painted on the middle on each side, leaving the white base on the hood, top and back of the car.
The logo was put on the front door in the upper left corner or right corner, depending on the side.
"Policia" (Police) was painted in white on the dark blue area of the front doors.
The motto, "Proteccion, Integridad" (Protection and Integrity) was painted in white on the dark blue area of the back doors.
On the yellow area, the name of the precinct, district or specialized unit was marked in dark blue.
On the back end of each side, "Emergencia 9-1-1" was painted in white on the dark blue area.
The back of the vehicle was marked with the patrol number, plus 9-1-1 and "Policia".
The patrol unit number was also applied to the top of each vehicle.
The light bar on the 2008 Interceptors was a blue LED with two search lights, mounted on the left and right of the bar.
A double search light was placed in the middle front.
The Ford Explorer was replaced by the Chevrolet Trailblazer for patrol duties, but many specialized units still use the Explorer.
In July 2009, the Highway Patrol division received the newest fleet of Dodge Charger for its Expressway Division, replacing the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.
These vehicles have a gray base color, with the logo in the middle of the front door and the words "Autopistas" (Expressway) and "Highway Patrol" under the logo.
On the back side of the trunk is the logo of the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works, in a smaller size.
A blue LED light bar is mounted inside the vehicle; it has two light bars in the front with two searchlights on its sides, and one complete light bar in the back.
The purpose of the new patrol car is to be what it calls a "Patrulla Fantasma" or Ghost Patrol Car.
It surprises speeders by pretending to be a government vehicle of the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works.
The Freeway Division of the Highway Patrol received the latest generation of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.
It has a gray base color, but the PPR logo is located only on the middle of the front door and without the logo of the Department of Transportation.
A blue LED light bar is mounted inside the car, exactly the same as the new Expressway patrol cars.
It plays the same role, Patrullas Fantasmas (Ghost Patrol).
After a poll with citizens and police personnel, the results show that public respect for officers suffered from the use of the yellow, blue and white color paint scheme referred to by officers as "Poli-Taxis".
On January 25, 2010, the fleet was completely changed, especially the patrol units serving the precincts and districts.
The department bought 47 Chevrolet Tahoe cars in 2010 at a cost of $1.2 million of U.S. funds.
This will completely replace the remaining Mitsubishi Montero and Ford Explorers patrolling the street for specialized units.
It also bought Suzuki model 8000 motorcycles to replace the Honda Shadow.
The Ford Crown Victoria with the yellow, blue and white colors ("Poli-Taxis") will be repainted.
Its new colors will be dark blue with reflective white lines on the back, sides and hood, the word "Policia" on each side, the logo on the back and upper sides, and "Emergencia 9-1-1" on the back window and back sides.
Motorcycles will have the same paint, but with new blue LED lights on the back and front.
Also, the maritime fleet and Air Fleet will also have a "makeover".
These changes were forecast to be on the streets of Puerto Rico by early February 2010.
The units of Autopistas (Highway Patrol) and Transito (Transit) with the gray base color and logo on the sides will not be affected by the color change.
========,3,Uniforms.
The Puerto Rico police uniforms have changed in style and color over the years.
The PRPD uniform of the 1930s was a long-sleeve, navy blue button shirt, with a gun belt about the waist and support crossing the chest.
Navy blue pants had a black line on the side of the legs from the waist down.
In the 1960s, the only change to the uniform was the gun belt.
The strap for the gun was only at the waist.
In that same year, the patch was the Great Seal of Puerto Rico under the name "Policia de Puerto Rico" (Police of Puerto Rico).
Later, in the late 1980s, the uniform was changed to a short-sleeve, light-blue button shirt.
The police patch changed to an image of a police officer saluting a family, near a road, with the view of the city and the mountains.
This patch is still in use.
In 2004, the patch was changed to an image of a man and woman dressed as police officers, with the U.S. and Puerto Rico flags behind, with the city and a "garita" or watch tower also behind.
This patch is less popular with the force and not worn as often as the previous patch.
The uniform in current use is the light-blue shirt, with long or short sleeves and navy blue pants, with the black line on the side of the legs from waist down.
Lieutenants, captains, inspectors and colonels have used either light-blue button shirts or white button shirts.
Officer headgear is either a black peaked cap or black police stetson.
The cap has a wreath of weath with number.
Specialized units, such as the Mounted police, wear the light-blue shirts, but reserve the long sleeves for ceremonies, wearing the short sleeves or the navy blue long sleeve shirt that says "Policia" (Police) on the back and the arms for coastal patrol.
The pants have a yellow line instead of a black line on the sides and are worn with riding boots.
========,2,Police regions.
The Puerto Rico Police is regionally divided into 13 police regions to provide better service to the public.
Each region has a commanding officer and 2 sub-commanding officers; one for investigation, and the other for field operations.

A significant distinction of this region from the 13 other regions in Puerto Rico, is the protection and enforcement of the island-municipalities of Vieques (located east of Puerto Rico), and Culebra (17 miles east of Puerto Rico).
Because of the islands' distance from Puerto Rico, they are easy places for drug connections from South America and North America.
This is why most of these areas are protected with a coordination of U.S. Federal Agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (D.E.A.)
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (A.T.F.).

========,3,Ponce massacre.
On March 21, 1937, more than 30 officers placed themselves in an intersection in downtown Ponce to block a march by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to celebrate the abolition of slavery and protest the incarceration of their leader Pedro Albizu Campos.
As the demonstrators marched, singing "La Borinqueña" (Puerto Rico's national anthem), General Blanton Winship, the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico, ordered Chief of Police Guillermo Soldevilla to open fire on the protesters.
In the massacre that lasted 15 minutes, 19 people died, including a seven-year-old girl.
This and other incidents involving the Insular Police fueled the Puerto Rico independence movement, leading to the burning of police stations and post offices in 1950, and the Jayuya Uprising.
