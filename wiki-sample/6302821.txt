"Pamina" was renamed "Tanner" in honor of U.S. Navy captain and oceanographer Zera Luther Tanner.
After sea trials during November and December, "Tanner" conducted hydrographic survey operations off the east coast of Mexico.
She continued similar activities in the same area, off Labrador, off Trinidad and off Venezuela for the next four years.
In January 1951, she began survey work in the Bahamas in connection with a guided missile testing range, work which she continued with only occasional missions elsewhere until the summer of 1952.
At that time she returned northward and after a period in New York Naval Shipyard proceeded to northwest Greenland for extensive priority survey work.
She concluded the season with a survey of a small island in the Canadian Arctic where a harbor was named "Tanner Bay" in her honor.
From 1954 to 1958, "Tanner" operated primarily off the southern coast of Turkey with 27,255 miles steamed during 139 days in the survey area in the spring and summer of 1956.

After extensive work in the Near East, she conducted research in the Barents Sea in 1963, in the deep dive area off Norfolk in 1964, and in the northern Aegean Sea 15 November 1965 to 15 March 1966.
"Tanner" deployed 19 October from Pearl Harbor for survey operations in the South China Sea off the Mekong Delta coast of South Vietnam.
She returned to the coast of South Vietnam and to the Gulf of Thailand in 1967 and 1968.
Following survey operations in the Western Pacific early in 1969 and with long and distinguished service to her credit, "Tanner" began her decommissioning process 14 July.
She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 August and transferred to the Maritime Administration for disposal.
