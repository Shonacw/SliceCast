========,2,Climate.
The climate in general is dry and characterised by scant rainfall.
The maximum rainfall is recorded in Gobichettipalayam and Bhavani, Tamil Nadu Taluk.
Unlike the nearby Coimbatore district which is blessed with a healthy climate,  Goundanpalayam village has dry weather throughout the year except during the monsoons.
The Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats, which has a moderating effect on the climate of Coimbatore district, does not render much help in bringing down the dry climate in this area.
The cool moist wind that gushes out of the west coast through Palghat gap, loses its coolness and becomes dry by the time it crosses Coimbatore district and reaches Goundampalayam.
Generally the first two months of the year are pleasant, but in March the temperature begins to rise, which persists till the end of May.
The highest temperatures are normally recorded during May.
The showers during this period do not provide much relief from the oppressive heat; however there is a slight improvement in the climate during the June–August period.
During the pre-monsoon period, the temperature reverses its trend.
By September the sky gets heavily overcast, although the rains are meagre.
The northeast monsoon sets in vigorously only during October–November, and by December the rains disappear, rendering the climate clear but pleasant.
