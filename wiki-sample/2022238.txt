========,1,preface.
Bomberman Max 2 is a video game released for the Game Boy Advance on 4 June 2002.
The game was preceded by "Bomberman Max" which was released for the Game Boy Color on May 14, 2000.
As with "Bomberman Max", there are two versions of "Bomberman Max 2": "Blue Advance" and "Red Advance".
As in the first, in "Blue Advance" the playable character is Bomberman and in "Red Advance" the playable character is Max.
========,2,Story.
Bomberman and Max have been shrunk by the evil Mujoe's Mini-Mini Device.
They must take revenge on him and his Hige Hige Gang, and, hopefully, return to their normal size.
========,2,Gameplay.
The gameplay is similar to most Bomberman games, where Bomberman and Max lay down bombs to destroy enemies, blocks, etc.
Unlike past Bomberman games, however, there is a lack of the classic multiplayer, instead featuring a more Pok√©mon-like game.
In this game, there are many monsters that Bomberman and Max can acquire and use to their advantage.
Both games are more or less the same, although they both have some extra levels and different charaboms.
