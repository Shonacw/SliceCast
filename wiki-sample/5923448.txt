DePaul College Prep, formerly known as Gordon Technical High School, is a Roman Catholic high school located in Chicago, Illinois, United States.
It is located on the north side of Chicago on Addison Street and California Avenue.
It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago.
The school was originally named in honor of the Very Reverend Francis Gordon, an influential and high-ranking member of the Congregation of the Resurrection.
The school was renamed DePaul College Prep in the summer of 2014.
========,2,School history.
Gordon Technical High School opened in 1952 as an all-male school at the corner of Division Street and Greenview Avenue on Chicago's Northwest Side.
The school was built in the wake of the relocation of another high school run by the Congregation of the Resurrection, Archbishop Weber High School, which closed in 1999.
The school was founded at the request of Cardinal Samuel Stritch, who envisioned a new type of Catholic high school, one that had both a college preparatory curriculum, and a technical curriculum.
The school moved to its current campus in 1961.
Its first website was launched in January 1998, at www.gordontech.org.
The school formally shortened its name to Gordon Tech in 1999.
In 2001, the new school motto was adopted, replacing the old motto "Ad Viros Faciendos" (For the Making of Men).
The school was all–male until declining enrollments and regional gentrification during the 1990s (including the closure of all-female Madonna High School in June 2001) prompted the school to begin admitting girls in August 2002.
The board of directors announced on March 12, 2014 that the names of the high school and its campus would be changed to DePaul College Prep and the Father Gordon Campus, respectively, as early as summer of that year.
New namesake DePaul University has been an academic partner since 2012.
The athletic mascot (Rams) and school colors (orange) have been retained.
The school changed the URL of its website to the present www.depaulprep.org beginning with the 2014-15 school year.
