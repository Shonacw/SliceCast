The Princess Theatre was established in 1925 by George Elam.

Leasing the building from Rowena Ramage, Elam worked to improve the building which was built in 1907.
Silent movies were shown on a screen while live piano music brought the films to life.
A few years later Elam bought records to play along with the movies.
When sound was added to films in 1930 Elam installed a sound system in the theatre.
In the early 1940s, Elam added onto the building, making it longer.
In 1960, Elam sold the theatre to Jack Pope.
Pope continued leasing the building from Ramage while keeping the Princess operating just as Elam had done.
