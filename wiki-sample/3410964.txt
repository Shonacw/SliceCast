========,1,preface.
The Jackson Dinky is a Superstrat-style double-cutaway electric guitar built by Jackson Guitars.
The "Dinky" is named for its slightly smaller than normal (7/8) body size.
Usually fitted with a two humbucker pickup configuration, some models also include single-coil pickups and/or just one bridge humbucker.
The fretboard can be made out of ebony, rosewood and more recently maple, or rock maple, with 24 jumbo frets and is always built with a bolt-on neck.
Most of the guitars have a Floyd Rose original or licensed tremolo, and a locking nut to help maintain stable tuning.
Some Dinkys have hardtail, or String-Thru bridges.
The Jackson Dinky is usually preferred by players of hard rock and heavy metal.
