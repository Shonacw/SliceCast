The first evidence of Vinga's existence as a small village dates back to 1231 A.D. After Vinga was destroyed by Turks during the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, Vinga was repopulated in the year 1741 with 125 families of ethnic Bulgarians from Chiprovtsi, joined later by Romanians from the surrounding area.
After World War I, a majority of these Bulgarian families moved to Arad and Timişoara.
After World War II, more and more Bulgarians moved to Vinga and began to own large and important pieces of land in the area.
During the communist regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu, the government promised to contribute and renovate Vinga so that it could be recognized as a small town.
However, these promises were not kept because the revolution of 1989 occurred and a new government was formed.
