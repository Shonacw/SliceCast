========,1,preface.
A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability.
The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites.
========,2,Definition.
Friars are different from monks in that they are called to live the evangelical counsels (vows of poverty, chastity and obedience) in service to society, rather than through cloistered asceticism and devotion.
Whereas monks live in a self-sufficient community, friars work among laypeople and are supported by donations or other charitable support.
A monk or nun makes their vows and commits to a particular community in a particular place.
Friars commit to a community spread across a wider geographical area known as a province, and so they will typically move around, spending time in different houses of the community within their province.
========,2,Etymology.
The English term "Friar" is derived from the Norman French word "frere" ("brethren"), from the Latin "frater" ("brother"), which was widely used in the Latin New Testament to refer to members of the Christian community.
"Fray" is sometimes used in former Spanish colonies such as the Philippines or the American Southwest as a title, such as in Fray Juan de Torquemada.
========,2,Uses by other Christian traditions.
Orders of friars (and sisters) exist in other Christian traditions, including the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, the Order of Ecumenical Franciscans and the Order of Lesser Sisters and Brothers.
In the Anglican Communion there are also a number of mendicant groups such as the Anglican Friars Preachers, The Society of St. Francis and Order of St Francis.
