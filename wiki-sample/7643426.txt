========,2,Early life.
Cebar recounts his musical journey beginning as an eleven-year-old back in the 1960s when he attended Milwaukee's Lakefront Festival of the Arts where he saw the Wild Magnolias from New Orleans as well as drummer Babatunde Olatunji and fell in love with the style and sound.
Cebar graduated from Pius XI High School in Milwaukee and began performing in coffeehouses on the local folk scene in the mid-1970s.
He first fell in love with New Orleans' music scene on a roadtrip in 1977 and has continued to return every year to the Jazz & Heritage Festival.
His repertoire consisted in large part of rhythm and blues and jump blues songs, played solo on his guitar.
He attended New College in Sarasota, Florida.
Afterwards, he played in New York City while working with the R&B Cadets in Milwaukee.
========,2,The R&B Cadets.
Throughout the early 1980s, Cebar was a member of a rock and R&B combo, The R&B Cadets, with Jon Sieger, Mike Sieger, Robyn Pluer, Bob Jennings, Juli Wood and Bob Schneider.
The band played Sieger's compositions, with obscure songs from the mid-20th century that Cebar had unearthed.
The R&B Cadets released an album entitled "Top Happy" in 1986, and a 7-inch 33 entitled "Get a Move On" in 1981, including the song "Hook, Line, and Sinker", "One Is Green", "Headin' for the Poor House" and "Down by the River".
During this period, Cebar and Claudia Schmidt released a 7-inch 45 "The Outskirts Of You" b/w "Baby, It's Cold Outside".
========,2,Paul Cebar & The Milwaukeeans.
Parallel to his work with the R&B Cadets, Cebar had his own group, Paul Cebar and the Milwaukeeans.
The group played many R&B, jazz,and bebop songs, by Louis Jordan, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and others.
The members were Cebar (acoustic guitar and vocals), Robin Pluer (vocals), Rip Tenor (saxophone) and Alan Anderson (bass guitar).
They were often joined by the percussionist Guy Hoffman.
After the Cadets disbanded in 1986 Cebar reconstituted the group, which then was made up of Cebar (guitar, vocals), Pluer (vocals), Juli Wood (saxophone), Anderson (bass guitar), Tenor (saxophone) and Randy Baugher (drums).
The band explored African, Latin American and Caribbean sounds in a rhythm and blues context.
The band gradually expanded into a unique R&B/Worldbeat fusion in the late 80s with horn section (Juli Wood, Tony Jarvis, Greg Tardy, Paul Scher), keyboard & accordion (Robin Pluer), lead guitar/lap steel (Peter Roller, Rob Gjersoe) and continuing Milwaukeeans (Cebar guitar/vocal, Al Anderson/electric bass, Randy Baugher/drums).
Popular in Chicago (Lounge Ax, Fitzgeralds, Cubby Bear) and Minneapolis (Fine Line, Cabooze) & their hometown.
The album best documenting this era is That Unhinged Thing (Shanachie 1993).
Reggie Bordeaux (who still performs with Cebar in his current band Paul Cebar and The Tomorrow Sound), was taught drums by his father from an early age.
He had much experience when he met Cebar; he had already performed with The Artist Formerly Known as Prince as the lead drummer.
His talent, combined with his performing experience, made him a perfect fit for Cebar's sound.
Bordeaux's gospel biased drumming style brought a unique element to Cebar's already distinctive music.
Garrison Keillor commented to Cebar after the band's performance on his show, "A Prairie Home Companion", "Mr. Reggie Bordeaux... You got a great percussion section there mister."
Patrick Patterson was one of the longest acting members of Paul Cebar & The Milwaukeeans, playing electric bass & singing harmony.
Some alumni of the band are:
<br>saxophone: Tony Jarvis, Greg Tardy (briefly), Paul Scher <br>guitar: Peter Roller (Yank Rachell), Rob Gjersoe (-> Jimmie Dale Gilmore, The Flatlanders), Terry Vittone <br>bass guitar: Mike Kachou, Ethan Bender (briefly), Patrick Patterson <br>percussion: Michael Walls, Romero Beverly
========,2,Paul Cebar & Tomorrow Sound.
The latest line-up includes the former R&B Cadet Bob Jennings (saxophone, keyboards), Mike Fredrickson (bass guitar), Reggie Bordeaux (drums) and McKinley "Mac" Perkins (percussion).
While earlier incarnations of the band were more pop-oriented, the band is heavily into African, Latin, Caribbean, reggae, zydeco, R&B and soul styles.
The band continues to perform regularly and tours the US.
========,2,Radio.
Cebar began guesting on local musician Steve Cohen's show on WMSE radio in Milwaukee in the early 1980s.
At the suggestion of another DJ there, he applied for, and received his own show, which he has hosted since 1985.
The show runs on Wednesdays from 9:00Â a.m. - noon.
In the late 1980s, he also began hosting a show on Sunday afternoons on WYMS in Milwaukee, which ran until the station changed its format in 2002.
