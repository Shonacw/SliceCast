Half the Perfect World is the fourth studio album by American jazz singer Madeleine Peyroux.
It was released on September 12, 2006.
It peaked at No.
33 on the "Billboard" 200 albums chart and had sold 218,000 copies in the United States by December 2008.
The album featured four original songs, all of them co-written by Peyroux: "I'm All Right," "A Little Bit," "Once in a While" and "California Rain."
This marked a change in Peyroux's style, who would, in March 2009, release her first album without any covers.
Peyroux did a cover of "Summer Wind," a song by Johnny Mercer, whom she always credits as a major influence on her music.
She also recorded three covers (two were issued on the standard edition; the bonus track "Crazy to Love You" was added to the Japanese one) from Leonard Cohen and Anjani Thomas' album "Blue Alert".
========,2,Singles and promotion.
"I'm All Right," "A Little Bit" and "Once in a While" were all released as singles.
The song "Blue Alert" can be heard in the 2007 Old Navy Denim Jeans commercial.
