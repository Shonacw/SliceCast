Second sound is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which heat transfer occurs by wave-like motion, rather than by the more usual mechanism of diffusion.
Heat takes the place of pressure in normal sound waves.
This leads to a very high thermal conductivity.
It is known as "second sound" because the wave motion of heat is similar to the propagation of sound in air.
Normal sound waves are fluctuations in the density of molecules in a substance; second sound waves are fluctuations in the density of particle-like thermal excitations (rotons and phonons).
Second sound can be observed in any system in which most phonon-phonon collisions conserve momentum.
This occurs in superfluids, and also in some dielectric crystals when Umklapp scattering is small.
========,2,Second sound in helium II.
Second sound is observed in liquid helium at temperatures below the lambda point, 2.1768 K, where He becomes a superfluid known as helium II.
Helium II has the highest thermal conductivity of any known material (several hundred times higher than copper).
Second sound can be observed either as pulses or in a resonant cavity.
The speed of second sound is close to zero near the lambda point, increasing to approximately 20 m/s around 1.8 K, about ten times slower than normal sound waves.
At temperatures below 1 K, the speed of second sound in helium II increases as the temperature decreases.
Second sound is also observed in superfluid helium-3 below its lambda point 2.5 mK.
========,2,Second sound in other media.
Second sound has been observed in solid He and He,
and in some dielectric solids such as Bi in the temperature
range of 1.2 to 4.0 K with a velocity of (0.78±0.05)×10 m/s,
or NaF around 10 to 20 K.
