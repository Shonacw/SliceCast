========,1,preface.
Richard Mark Hammond (19 December 1969) is a British presenter, writer, and journalist, known for co-hosting the BBC Two motoring programme "Top Gear" from 2002 until 2015 with Jeremy Clarkson and James May.
He has also presented "" (2003–2006), "Total Wipeout" (2009–2012) and "Planet Earth Live" (2012).
In 2016, Hammond began presenting "The Grand Tour" television series, produced by W. Chump & Sons.
The show is co-presented with his former "Top Gear" co-hosts, Clarkson and May, as an exclusive distributed via Amazon Video to Amazon Prime customers.
In November 2016 Hammond, alongside the co-presenters of "The Grand Tour", Jeremy Clarkson and James May, launched the automotive social media website DriveTribe, where he regularly provides content on his tribe "Hammond's Fob Jockeys".
========,2,Early life.
Hammond was born in Solihull, Warwickshire, and is the grandson of workers in the Birmingham car industry.
In the mid-1980s Hammond moved with his family (mother Eileen, father Alan, and younger brothers Andrew, writer of the 'Crypt' Series, and Nicholas) to the North Yorkshire cathedral city of Ripon where his father ran a probate business in the market square.
He attended Blossomfield Infant School in Shirley from the age of 3–7.
Originally a pupil of Solihull School, a fee-paying boys' independent school, he moved to Ripon Grammar School, and from 1986 to 1988 attended Harrogate College of Art and Technology.
========,2,Career.
========,3,"Top Gear".
 Hammond became a presenter on "Top Gear" in 2002, when the show began in its present format.
He is sometimes referred to as "The Hamster" by fans and his co-presenters on "Top Gear" due to his name and comparatively small stature.
His nickname was further reinforced when on three separate occasions in series 7, he ate cardboard, mimicking hamster-like behaviour.
Following a high-speed dragster crash while filming in September 2006 near York, Hammond returned in the first episode of series 9 (broadcast on 28 January 2007) to a hero's welcome, complete with dancing girls, aeroplane-style stairs and fireworks.
The show also contained images of the crash, which had made international headlines, with Hammond talking through the events of the day after which the audience broke into spontaneous applause.
Hammond then requested that the crash never be mentioned on the show again, though all three "Top Gear" presenters have since referred to it in jokes during the news segment of the programme.
He told his colleagues, "The only difference between me now, and before the crash, is that I like celery now and I didn't before".
During the second episode of series sixteen, Hammond suggested that no one would ever want to own a Mexican car, since cars are supposed to reflect national characteristics and so a Mexican car would be "lazy, feckless, flatulent, overweight, leaning against a fence, asleep, looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat."
Hammond finished with the remark "I'm sorry, but can you imagine waking up and remembering you're Mexican?!"
Following complaints, the BBC defended the broadcast of this segment on the grounds that such national stereotyping was a "robust part" of traditional British humour.
Following the BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract with the show on 25 March 2015, Hammond's contract expired on 31 March.
In April he ruled out the possibility of continuing to present "Top Gear", commenting via Twitter that "amidst all this talk of us 'quitting' or not: there's nothing for me to 'quit' not about to quit my mates anyway".
On 12 June 2015 the BBC confirmed that "Top Gear" will return with a 75-minute special, combining two unseen challenges featuring all three presenters from series 22, with studio links from Hammond and May.
It aired in the UK on BBC Two on 28 June at 8 p.m, and in the United States on BBC America on 13 July at 9 p.m.
========,3,"Brainiac: Science Abuse".
In 2003, Hammond became the first presenter of ""; he was joined by Jon Tickle and Charlotte Hudson in series 2.
After the fourth series it was announced that Hammond was no longer going to present the Sky1 show after he signed an exclusive deal with the BBC.
Vic Reeves took his place as main presenter.
========,3,Other television work.
Early in his career, as well as his radio work, Hammond presented a number of daytime lifestyle shows and motoring programmes such as Motor Week on "Men & Motors".

While in New Zealand for "Top Gear Live 2009", Hammond filmed several television commercials for Telecom New Zealand's new XT UTMS mobile network.
Telecom claimed that the new network was "faster in more places", compared to its competitors and its existing CDMA network.
After the network suffered three highly publicised outages in late 2009 and early 2010, Hammond became the butt of a joke when he did not return to New Zealand for "Top Gear Live 2010".
His fellow "Top Gear" co-hosts said he was too embarrassed to come back to New Zealand, and in a supposed live feed back to Hammond, the feed suddenly drops out as the "XT Network had crashed".
Hammond was later given the right of reply to his colleagues during an interview with Marcus Lush on RadioLIVE's breakfast show in New Zealand.

========,2,Personal life.
Richard Hammond has been married to Amanda "Mindy" Etheridge (born 6 July 1965), a columnist for the "Daily Express", since May 2002.
They have two daughters.
Hammond is known for owning a large number of animals on Bollitree farm including several horses, dogs, cats, chickens, ducks, sheep, and a peacock.
He and his family adopted TG, the official Top Gear dog, after it became apparent that the labradoodle was afraid of cars.
The dog died aged 11 in January 2017.
The presenter plays the bass guitar, on which he accompanied the other "Top Gear" presenters when they performed alongside Justin Hawkins on "Top Gear of the Pops" for Comic Relief in 2007.
He likes to ride his bicycle, scooter, or motorbike in cities, for which he is mocked mercilessly by fellow presenter Jeremy Clarkson.
During the news segment of special, Hammond openly expressed his dislike of the band Genesis.
This fact was later exploited by his co-presenters (particularly by Clarkson) in three special episodes: during the , when they installed a secret second stereo unit in his Fiat Barchetta that only plays the band's Seconds Out album; in the , Clarkson played the same song used in the previous special through the megaphone mounted in his Jaguar XJS, despite Hammond driving a different car (a Mini Cooper Sport).
In the 2013 Africa Special, Clarkson once again played Genesis in an attempt to get Hammond to let him pass.
In 2007, Hammond went to Africa on a , with his choice of car being a 1963 Opel Kadett, which he subsequently named Oliver.
A week after the special was aired, Hammond announced during the news section that he had shipped Oliver back to the UK, where it was restored by a team from "Practical Classics" magazine.
Oliver features on Hammond's children's science television show "Richard Hammond's Blast Lab" and in another episode of "Top Gear" as a kind of "Hill-holder" in the trailer truck challenge (after it acquired the fake personal plate "OLI V3R").
Oliver is also mentioned in Hammond's second autobiography "As You Do".
In 2010, Hammond was the president of the 31st Herefordshire Country Fair held at Hampton Court in Hope under Dinmore.
His involvement caused unprecedented attendance with "nearly 15,000 people" drawn to the event to meet the presenter.
In March 2012, Hammond passed his B206 LST helicopter licence and has since owned a Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter.
========,3,Residences.
The Hammond family lives in a mock castle in Herefordshire and also has an apartment in London.
In an interview with "The Sunday Times" in February 2008, it was reported that Hammond had moved briefly from Gloucestershire to Buckinghamshire, then back again, because he missed the country life.
In October 2012, it was reported he had spent over £2 million buying Bollitree Castle which is situated near Weston under Penyard, Ross-on-Wye.
It has been rumoured he has also bought a large house in the small town of Wantage, Oxfordshire.

========,2,Charity work.
Richard Hammond has been an ambassador of UK children's brain injury charity The Children's Trust, Tadworth for many years.
On 29 September 2013, terminally-ill eight-year-old Emilia Palmer was driven by Richard Hammond in a pink Lamborghini Aventador Roadster.
Hammond flew his Robinson R44 helicopter, G-OHAM, to Shobdon Aerodrome, then picked Palmer up from her home in Kimbolton, Herefordshire and drove her back to the airport for a high-speed run on the main runway.
The event was arranged at short notice by Rays of Sunshine.
========,2,"Vampire" dragster crash.
During filming of a "Top Gear" segment at the former RAF Elvington airbase near York on 20 September 2006, Hammond was injured in the crash of the jet-powered car he was piloting.
He was travelling at at the time of the crash.
His vehicle, a dragster called "Vampire", was theoretically capable of travelling at speeds of up to .
The vehicle was the same car that in 2000, piloted by Colin Fallows, set the British land speed record at .
The "Vampire" was powered by a single Bristol-Siddeley Orpheus afterburning turbojet engine producing of thrust.
Some accounts suggested that the accident occurred during an attempt to break the British land speed record, but the Health and Safety Executive report on the crash found that a proposal to try to officially break the record was vetoed in advance by "Top Gear" executive producer Andy Wilman, due to the risks and complexities of such a venture.
The report stated: "Runs were to be carried out in only one direction along a pre-set course on the Elvington runway.
Vampire’s speed was to be recorded using GPS satellite telemetry.
The intention was to record the maximum speed, not to measure an average speed over a measured course, and for (Hammond) to describe how it felt."
Hammond was completing a seventh and final run to collect extra footage for the programme when his front-right tyre failed, and, according to witness and paramedic Dave Ogden, "one of the parachutes had deployed but it went on to the grass and spun over and over before coming to a rest about 100 yards from us."
The emergency crew quickly arrived at the car, finding it inverted and partially embedded in the grass.
During the roll, Hammond's helmet had embedded itself into the ground, flipping the visor up and forcing soil into his mouth and damaging his left eye.
Rescuers felt a pulse and heard the unconscious Hammond breathing before the car was turned upright.
Hammond was cut free with hydraulic shears, and placed on a backboard.
"He was regaining consciousness at that point and said he had some lower back pain".
He was then transported by the Yorkshire Air Ambulance to the neurological unit of the Leeds General Infirmary.
Hammond's family visited him at the hospital along with "Top Gear" co-presenters James May and Jeremy Clarkson.
Clarkson wished Hammond well, saying "Both James and I are looking forward to getting our 'Hamster' back", referring to Hammond by his nickname.
The Health & Safety Executive report stated that "Hammond's instantaneous reaction to the tyre blow-out seems to have been that of a competent high performance car driver, namely to brake the car and to try to steer into the skid.
Immediately afterwards he also seems to have followed his training and to have pulled back on the main parachute release lever, thus shutting down the jet engine and also closing the jet and afterburner fuel levers.
The main parachute did not have time to deploy before the car ran off the runway."
The HSE notes that, based on the findings of the North Yorkshire Police (who investigated the crash), "the accident may not have been recoverable", even if Hammond's efforts to react were as fast as "humanly possible".
The crash was shown on an episode of "Top Gear" on 28 January 2007; this was the first episode of the new series, which had been postponed pending Hammond's recovery.
Hammond requested at the end of the episode that his fellow presenters never mention the crash again, a request which has been generally observed, although occasional oblique references have been made by all three presenters.
"On The Edge: My Story", which contains first-hand accounts from both Hammond and his wife about the crash, immediate aftermath, and his recovery, was published later that year.
Hammond also appeared on the BBC chat show "Friday Night with Jonathan Ross" revealing he was "a bit fighty" right after the crash and then in a coma for two weeks.
In February 2008 Hammond gave an interview to "The Sunday Times" newspaper in which he described the effects of his brain injuries and the progression of his recovery.
He reported suffering loss of memory, depression and difficulties with emotional experiences, for which he was consulting a psychiatrist.
He also talked about his recovery in a 2010 television programme where he interviewed Sir Stirling Moss and they discussed the brain injuries they had both received as a result of car crashes.
