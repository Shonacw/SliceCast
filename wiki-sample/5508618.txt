========,2,Station layout.
There is a connecting passage from the Tobu station to the Tokyo Metro Station, and a connecting passage from the Tokyo Metro portion to the Toei portion.
However, there are no direct connecting passages from the Toei portion to the Tobu portion or from the Tsukuba Express station to the rest of the station complex.
Passengers wishing to transfer between the Toei and the Tobu stations have to walk at street level, while passengers transferring between the Tsukuba Express station and the rest of the complex must also walk at street level, as the Tsukuba Express station is located 600 meters to the west of the station complex.
========,3,Tobu Railway.
The Tobu Railway terminal is a surface station, which occupies a portion of the Matsuya Department Store.
The station is used by local and limited express trains.
Although Asakusa is the most "central" terminal of the Isesaki Line, it is connected to the next major terminal, Kita-Senju Station, by a length of track with sharp curves, beginning with the first stretch leaving the station, where trains have to turn 90 degrees to the right at a maximum speed of 15Â km/h to cross the Sumida River.
In part due to the station's somewhat awkward location, many express and semi-express services on the Skytree Line run through Kita-Senju to the Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line and Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line rather than continue to Asakusa.
