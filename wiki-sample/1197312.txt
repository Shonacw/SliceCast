Ahamdho, Khunbum, and Taktser respectively.

In Hinduism, Lake Manasasarovar is a personification of purity, and one who drinks water from the lake will go to the abode of Shiva after death.
He is believed to be cleansed of all his sins committed over even a hundred lifetimes.
Like Mount Kailash, Lake Manasasarovar is a place of pilgrimage, attracting religious people from India, Nepal, Tibet and neighboring countries.
Bathing in Manasasarovar and drinking its water is believed by Hindus to cleanse all sins.
Pilgrimage tours are organized regularly, especially from India, the most famous of which is the yearly "Kailash Manas Sarovar Yatra".
Pilgrims come to take ceremonial baths in the waters of the lake.
Lake Manasasarovar has long been viewed by the pilgrims as being nearby to the sources of four great rivers of Asia, namely the Brahmaputra, Ghaghara, Sindhu and Sutlej, thus it is an axial point which has been thronged to by pilgrims for thousands of years.
The region was closed to pilgrims from the outside following the Battle of Chamdo; no foreigners were allowed between 1951 and 1980.
After the 1980s it has again become a part of the Indian pilgrim trail.
According to the Hinduism, the lake was first created in the mind of Brahma after which it manifested on Earth.
Hence it is called "Manasa sarovaram", which is a combination of the Sanskrit words for "mind" and "lake".
The lake is also supposed to be the summer abode of the hamsa.
Considered to be sacred, the hamsa is an important element in the symbology of the subcontinent, representing wisdom and beauty.
According to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes; collectively called "Panch-Sarovar"; Mansarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar.
They are also mentioned in Shrimad Bhagavata Purana.
