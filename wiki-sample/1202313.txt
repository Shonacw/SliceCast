========,1,preface.
The Crowninshield family is an American family that has been prominent in seafaring, political and military leadership, and the literary world.
The founder of the American family emigrated from what is now Germany in the late 17th century.
The family is one of several known collectively as Boston Brahmins.
========,2,History.
Johann Caspar Richter was an Old Saxon landowner and shipper-trader originally from the south of Denmark.
He moved to the German village of Kronenschieldt (sometimes spelled Cronenschieldt), near Leipzig, during the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) and married Maria Hahn, from Annaburg in Saxony-Anhalt.
The family adopted the village's name as their surname.
Their son, Johannes Caspar Richter von Kronenschieldt, was born in Leipzig circa 1661.
After being educated briefly at the University of Leipzig, he moved to Boston, Massachusetts in about 1688.
He anglicized his name to "John Caspar Crowninshield" and married Elizabeth Allen on December 5, 1694 in Lynn, Massachusetts, and bought the land near Spring Pond.
Their children began the Crowninshield family known today.
He died December 19, 1711.
His great-granddaughter Mary Crowinshield (1778–1835) was the wife of Senator Nathaniel Silsbee, whose son-in-law was Jared Sparks.
Although the family's roots are Danish and German, most of the more recent lines of the Crowninshield family in Massachusetts are primarily of English stock.
========,2,Influence in America.
========,3,Seafaring.
Shortly after moving to Essex County, Massachusetts, and especially the town of Salem, the Crowninshields began to make their impact on American seafaring.
They helped settle Salem and led it to seafaring prominence, helping turn it into an important seaport as well as a settlement for affluent families by the late 18th century.
George Crowninshield (1733–1815) founded the Crowninshield & Sons shipping business with his five sons.
In Salem, the family built Crowninshield's Wharf, one of three major town wharfs at the time.
As a result, the Crowninshields became highly influential in the international trade in tea (including Bohea from as far as China), cod, molasses, Madeira wine, Valencia oranges, Málaga grapes, salt, iron, and other goods.
The family was responsible for starting the first major pepper sea trade.
The earlier pepper trade between Asia and Europe had been land-based.
Lieutenant Benjamin Crowninshield (b.
1757) served from 17 October 1778 on the American privateer "Black Prince" during the American Revolution, which raided Fishguard and disrupted British merchant shipping.
He was a son of Jacob Crowninshield (1732–1774) and Hannah Carlton (1734–1824).
A son of George Crowninshield (b.
1733), sea adventurer George Crowninshield Jr. (1766–1817) built and sailed the yacht "Cleopatra's Barge", named after the ancient ship used by Cleopatra VII.
It became the first yacht to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
========,3,Government and military.
Although the family's prominence was originally gained via seafaring, Crowninshields later became most noted for the public service, primarily in politics and the military.
The early Crowninshields were Republicans and were noted for their strong support of Thomas Jefferson.
The Crowninshields were particularly praised for their naval leadership.
Benjamin Williams Crowninshield was United States Secretary of the Navy under both James Madison and James Monroe, while his great-great-grandson Charles Francis Adams III, also a noted yachtsman, was secretary under Herbert Hoover.
Former U.S. Representative Jacob Crowninshield was appointed to be the second person to hold the position by Thomas Jefferson, but did not serve due to his ill health.
His grandson Arent S. Crowninshield served as an admiral in the United States Navy and later as chief of the Navy's Bureau of Navigation during the McKinley Administration.
William Crowninshield Endicott was United States Secretary of War during Grover Cleveland's first term as President of the United States.
Caspar F. Crowninshield served as a Union Army captain and brevet brigadier general during the American Civil War, while Charles Francis Adams, Jr., great-grandson of Benjamin Williams Crowninshield, served as a general.
Since the late 19th century, the family's political influence has been exercised primarily at the state and local levels, including in Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York, where multiple branches of the family settled, as well as in Massachusetts.

He stepped down as executive editor and became a member of the editorial board and vice president at large in 1991.
========,3,Other contributions.
The Crowninshields were responsible for bringing the first elephant to the U.S.
The elephant arrived on April 12, 1796, brought by Jacob Crowninshield, who had purchased it in India.
The two-year-old elephant was brought into New York City, costing Crowninshield a total of $450.
It later toured the country extensively after Crowninshield sold it for $10,000.

He settled on the land in the interest of retreat and farming.
