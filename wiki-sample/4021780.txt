========,2,Anecdotes.
The sentence "The svastika is calling you" which is heard at the very end of the song "Torture Tactics", is taken from the movie The Blues Brothers.
This sentence is yelled on the megaphone by the head of the Illinois Nazi Party (played by Henry Gibson) during the scene of the bridge.
"Torture Tactics" being a very caricatured political song towards Nazis, this sentence is suited, since The Blues Brothers is a caricatured movie too.
