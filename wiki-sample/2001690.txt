========,3,Raw.
"Hoe" (), the raw fish or meat dish, can be devided into "saengseon-hoe" (), filleted raw fish, and "yukhoe" (), sliced raw meat.
"Saengseon-hoe" () can be either "hwareo-hoe" () made from freshly killed fish, or "seoneo-hoe" () made using aged fish.
"Mulhoe" () is a cold raw fish soup.
========,3,Blanched.
"Sukhoe" () is a blanched fish, seafood, meat, or vegetable dish.
"Ganghoe" () is a dish of rolled and tied ribbons made with blanched vegetables such as water dropworts and scallions.
========,2,Preparation.
"Hwareo-hoe" () is prepared by filleting freshly killed fish, while "seoneo-hoe" () is made with aged fish in a similar way to prepare Japanese "sashimi": removing the blood and innards and ageing the fish at certain temperature before filleting.
Fish or seafood "hoe" is often served with gochujang-based dipping sauces, such as "cho-gochujang" (chili paste mixed with vinegar) and "ssamjang" (chili paste mixed with soybean paste).
Hoe is often eaten wrapped in "ssam" (wrap) vegetables, such as lettus and perilla leaves.
After eating "hoe" at a restaurant, "maeun-tang" (spicy fish stew) made with the bones, head, and the remaining meat of the fish, can be served as an add-on dish.
========,2,History.
Historians assume the tradition of eating "hoe" was imported from China to Korea during early in the Three Kingdoms Period (57 BC-668 AD), facilitated by frequent exchanges between China and Korea on the Korean peninsula.
According to the Confucian "Analects", written in the 1st century BC, Confucius said "Do not shun rice that is well clean; do not shun "kuai" that is thinly sliced" (食不厭精，膾不厭細).
While the term "kuai" () originally referred to finely sliced raw fish or other meats such as beef or lamb, since the Qing and Han Dynasties it has referred mainly to raw fish.
With the popularization of Buddhism in Korea, beginning in the middle of the Three Kingdoms Period, and running late into the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392), the consumption of fish and other meat products (including "hoe") declined.
As the influence of Buddhism waned in the late Goryeo Dynasty period, the consumption of "hoe" began to lose its stigma.
During the Joseon Dynasty, the state promoted Confucianism, and, as Confucius was known to have enjoyed eating raw meat, "hoe" consumption greatly increased.
Today, the consumption of raw meat or seafood in Chinese cuisine is rare outside of a few regions, such as Chaozhou where dishes such as "yusheng" are popular.
