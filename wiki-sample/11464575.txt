========,1,preface.
The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a registered European charity founded in 1983 by Richard Portes, FBA, CBE, is a network of over 1100 researchers based mainly in universities throughout Europe, who collaborate through the centre in research and its dissemination.
CEPR's office is located in London but CEPR is a Think-Net drawing on academic research across Europe.
========,2,Mission.
The Centre's mission is to promote research excellence and policy relevance in European economics.
The CEPR network consists of over 900 Research Fellows and Affiliates based in over 237 different institutions in 28 countries (90% in the European Union).
Because it draws on such a large network of researchers, CEPR is able to produce a wide range of research that reflects a broad spectrum of individual viewpoints and perspectives.
========,2,Funding.
The Centre is partly funded by corporate members, mostly banks.
These institutions receive special benefits by obtaining different levels of membership.
The Centre's annual return in 2013 stated that it had an income for the financial year 2012-2013 of £3,179,298 and an expenditure of £3,345,054.
========,2,Discussion papers.
The Centre disseminates its research in the first instance through the CEPR Discussion Paper Series, in which it publishes almost 700 papers annually.
As of April 2013, the CEPR series is ranked ninth among all economics working paper series and journals in terms of total downloads, according to the RePEc database.
========,2,VoxEUorg.
VoxEU.org is a policy portal set up by CEPR in conjunction with a consortium of other European sites, including the Italian site LaVoce (which provided inspiration for the idea and help from the start), the French site Telos, the Spanish site Sociedad Abierta, and the German Ökonomenstimme.
VoxEU aims to enrich the economic policy debate in Europe and beyond.
VoxEU promotes research-based policy analysis and commentary by leading economists.
The intended audience is economists in governments, international organisations, academia and the private sector as well as journalists specializing in economics, finance and business.
The main editors are leading European economists and economic journalists including: Richard Baldwin, Tito Boeri, Juan Dolado, Romesh Vaitilingam, and Charles Wyplosz.
