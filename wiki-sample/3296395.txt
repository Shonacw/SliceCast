========,1,preface.
Sati (in Pali; Sanskrit: "smṛti") is mindfulness or awareness, a spiritual or psychological faculty ("indriya") that forms an essential part of Buddhist practice.
It is the first factor of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment.
"Correct" or "right" mindfulness (Pali: "sammā-sati", Sanskrit "samyak-smṛti") is the seventh element of the Noble Eightfold Path.
========,2,Definition.
The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term "sati" and in its Sanskrit counterpart smṛti.
According to Robert Sharf, the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.
"Smṛti" originally meant "to remember", "to recollect", "to bear in mind", as in the Vedic tradition of remembering sacred texts.
The term "sati" also means "to remember".
In the "Satipațțhāna-sutta" the term "sati" means to remember the dharmas, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.
Sharf refers to the Milindapanha, which explained that the arisement of "sati" calls to mind the wholesome dhammas such as the four establishments of mindfulness, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening-factors, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the attainment of insight.
According to Rupert Gethin,  Sharf further notes that this has little to do with "bare attention", the popular contemporary interpretation of "sati", "since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise".
According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths".
According to Vetter, "dhyana" may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.
========,2,Translations.
The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term "sati" and in its Sanskrit counterpart "smṛti".
Translators rendered the Sanskrit word as "trenpa" in Tibetan (wylie: "dran pa") and as "nian" 念 in Chinese.
========,3,Pali.
The Pali-language scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843–1922) first translated ' in 1881 as English ' in "sammā-sati" "Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind".
Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered "sammā-sati" as "Correct meditation", Davids explained, 
Henry Alabaster, in "The Wheel of the Law: Buddhism Illustrated From Siamese Sources by the Modern Buddhist, A Life of Buddha, and an Account of the Phrabat" (1871), had earlier defined "Satipatthan/Smrityupasthana" as "The act of keeping one's self mindful."
The English term "mindfulness" already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context.
It was first recorded as "myndfulness" in 1530 (John Palsgrave translates French "pensee"), as "mindfulnesse" in 1561, and "mindfulness" in 1817.
Morphologically earlier terms include "mindful" (first recorded in 1340), "mindfully" (1382), and the obsolete "mindiness" (ca.
John D. Dunne, an associate professor at Emory University whose current research focuses especially on the concept of "mindfulness" in both theoretical and practical contexts, asserts that the translation of "sati" and "smṛti" as mindfulness is confusing and that a number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish "retention" as the preferred alternative.
Bhikkhu Bodhi also points to the meaning of "sati" as "memory":
========,3,Sanskrit.
The Sanskrit word "smṛti" स्मृति (also transliterated variously as "smriti", "smRti", or "sm'Rti") literally means "that which is remembered", and refers both to "mindfulness" in Buddhism and "a category of metrical texts" in Hinduism, considered second in authority to the "Śruti" scriptures.
Monier Monier-Williams's "Sanskrit-English Dictionary" differentiates eight meanings of "smṛti" स्मृति, "remembrance, reminiscence, thinking of or upon, calling to mind, memory":
***LIST***.
========,3,Chinese.
Buddhist scholars translated "smṛti" with the Chinese word "nian" 念 "study; read aloud; think of; remember; remind".
"Nian" is commonly used in Modern Standard Chinese words such as "guannian" 觀念 (观念) "concept; idea", "huainian" 懷念 (怀念) "cherish the memory of; think of", "nianshu" 念書 (念书) "read; study", and "niantou" 念頭 (念头) "thought; idea; intention".
Two specialized Buddhist terms are "nianfo" 念佛 "chant the name of Buddha; pray to Buddha" and "nianjing" 念經 (念经) "chant/recite sutras".
This Chinese character "nian" 念 is composed of "jin" "now; this" and "xin" "heart; mind".
Bernhard Karlgren graphically explains "nian" meaning "reflect, think; to study, learn by heart, remember; recite, read – to have 今 present to 心 the mind".
The Chinese character "nian" or "nien" 念 is pronounced as Korean "yeom" or "yŏm" 염, Japanese ネン or "nen", and Vietnamese "niệm".
"A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms" gives basic translations of "nian": "Recollection, memory; to think on, reflect; repeat, intone; a thought; a moment."
The "Digital Dictionary of Buddhism" gives more detailed translations of "nian" "mindfulness, memory":

========,2,Practice.
According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths."
Mindfulness is an antidote to delusion (Pali: "Moha"), and is considered as such one of the 'powers' (Pali: "bala") that contribute to the attainment of nirvana.
The faculty of mindfulness becomes a power in particular when it is coupled with clear comprehension of whatever is taking place.
According to Vetter, "dhyana" may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.
Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and delusion (Pali: "moha") have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.
========,3,Anapanasati.
Ānāpānasati (Pali; Sanskrit: "ānāpānasmṛti"; Chinese: 安那般那; Pīnyīn: "ānnàbānnà"; Sinhala: ආනා පානා සති), meaning "mindfulness of breathing" ("sati" means mindfulness; "ānāpāna" refers to inhalation and exhalation), is a form of Buddhist meditation now common to the Tibetan, Zen, Tiantai, and Theravada schools of Buddhism, as well as western-based mindfulness programs.
Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body, as is practiced in the context of mindfulness.
According to tradition, Anapanasati was originally taught by the Buddha in several sutras including the "Ānāpānasati Sutta".
(MN 118)
========,3,Satipaṭṭhāna.
The Buddha advocated that one should establish mindfulness ("satipaṭṭhāna") in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of one's body, feelings, mind, and dharmas.
The practice of mindfulness supports analysis resulting in the arising of wisdom (Pali: "paññā", Sanskrit: "prajñā").
A key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that meditative stabilisation must be combined with liberating discernment.
The Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (Sanskrit: "Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra") is an early text dealing with mindfulness.
========,3,Vipassanā.
Vipassanā (Pāli) is commonly used as a synonym for vipassanā-meditation, in which satipatthana, four foundations of mindfulness or anapanasati, "mindfulness of breathing," is used to become aware of the impermanence of everything that exists.
Vipassanā in the Buddhist tradition means insight into the true nature of reality.
In the Theravadin context, this entails insight into the three marks of existence, namely the impermanence of and the unsatisfactoriness of every conditioned thing that exists, and non-self.
In Mahayana contexts, it entails insight into what is variously described as sunyata, dharmata, the inseparability of appearance and emptiness (two truths doctrine), clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness.
Vipassanā is commonly used as one of two poles for the categorization of types of Buddhist practice, the other being samatha (Pāli; Sanskrit: "śamatha").
Though both terms appear in the Sutta Pitaka, Gombrich and Brooks argue that the distinction as two "separate" paths originates in the earliest "interpretations" of the Sutta Pitaka, not in the suttas themselves.
Various traditions disagree which techniques belong to which pole.
According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, samatha is used as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation.
Vipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after Theravāda Buddhism meditation practices, which employs vipassanā and ānāpāna meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the Sutta.
========,3,"Samprajaña", "apramāda" and "atappa".
In Buddhist practice, "mindfulness" also includes "samprajaña", meaning "clear comprehension" and "apramāda" meaning "vigilance".
All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as "mindfulness", but they all have specific shades of meaning.
In a publicly available correspondence between Bhikkhu Bodhi and B. Alan Wallace, Bodhi has described Ven.
Nyanaponika Thera's views on "right mindfulness" and sampajañña as follows:
In the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, sati and sampajañña are combined with "atappa" (Pali; Sanskrit: "ātapaḥ"), or "ardency," and the three together comprise "yoniso manisikara" (Pali; Sanskrit: "yoniśas manaskāraḥ"), "appropriate attention" or "wise reflection."
========,3,"Bare attention".
Georges Dreyfus has expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as "bare attention" or "nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness", stressing that mindfulness in Buddhist context means also "remembering", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information.
Dreyfus concludes his examination by stating:
Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of "correct view", not just "bare attention":
Jay Garfield, quoting Shantideva and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, "calling to mind" and vigilantly "retaining in mind".
He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of morality – at least in the context of Buddhism from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.
========,3,Āgamas.
The Āgamas of early Buddhism discuss ten forms of mindfulness.
The Ekottara Āgama has:
***LIST***.
According to Nan Huaijin, the Ekottara Āgama emphasizes mindfulness of breathing more than any of the other methods, and provides the most specific teachings on this one form of mindfulness.
