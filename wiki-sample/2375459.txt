"Lucky Child" tells the story of Loung Ung and her sister Chou Ung.
Each chapter alternates between their stories.
Loung lives in Vermont as a refugee with her older brother Meng and his wife Eang.
Meng only had enough money to bring one of his siblings with him, so he had to leave the rest of his family.
He chose Loung to come with him because she was the youngest, ten years old upon leaving Cambodia; hence, she is the "lucky child."
