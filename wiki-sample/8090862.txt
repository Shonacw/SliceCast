The rose points towards the capital of Sakalamaa.
The swords represent Sakala's important role in the Estonian ancient freedom fight and fighting spirit, as silver stands for loyalty.
The ship's motto in Latin is ""In nomine libertatis‚Äù" meaning "In the name of freedom".
The coat of arms was designed by Priit Herodes.
