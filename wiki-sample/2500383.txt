She was previously a television producer and script editor.
The most famous post being the executive producer of BBC's "EastEnders" between 2002-04.
During her tenure, the long-running soap opera received heavy media criticism and ratings slumped to just over 6 million viewers.
Since then she has gone on to write a successful series of historical fiction novels with high acclaim.

She worked first as a teacher before moving into the television industry.
========,2,Television career.
Louise started as script editor on Central Television's comedy drama "Boon", then moved to Granada Television to work on the medical drama "Medics".
Her big break came in 1993 when she became the series script editor for BBC1 soap opera "EastEnders", later going on to become the series story editor, where she worked on the highly successful storyline "Sharongate".
In 1995, she left the popular soap to become a producer.
She started as a producer with video drama, doing a series of "Medics", followed by two series of "Staying Alive", and then moved to film drama.
Her credits include "Messiah", "McCready and Daughter", "Ambassador II", and an adaptation of "Wuthering Heights".
========,3,"EastEnders".
In January 2002, Berridge returned to "EastEnders" when she was appointed Series Producer of the show, and four months later she was promoted to Executive Producer.
During her time there, she introduced characters, such as Alfie Moon, Dennis Rickman, Chrissie Watts, Jane Beale, Stacey Slater and the critically panned Indian Ferreira family.
She axed several long standing characters including Mark Fowler and Roy Evans.
Berridge was responsible for some ratings success stories, such as the Alfie/Kat love storyline, Janine Butcher leaving the show and getting her comeuppance, Jamie Mitchell's death and the return of one of the greatest soap icons, "Dirty" Den Watts who had been presumed dead for fourteen years.
His return in late 2003 was watched by over 16 million viewers, putting "EastEnders" back at number one in the rating war with the ITV's rival soap "Coronation Street".
However, other storylines, such as a storyline about a kidney transplant involving the Ferrieras, were not well received, and although Den Watts' return proved to be a ratings success, the British press branded the plot unrealistic and felt that it questioned the show's credibility.
A severe press backlash followed after Den's actor, Leslie Grantham, was outed in an internet sex scandal, which coincided with a swift decline in viewer ratings.
On 21 September 2004, Berridge quit as executive producer of "EastEnders" following continued criticism of the show.
The same day the programme received its lowest ever ratings at that time (6.2 million) when ITV scheduled an hour-long episode of its rival soap, "Emmerdale", against it.
"Emmerdale" was watched by 8.1 million people.
Her immediate superior, Mal Young (at the time BBC Controller of Continuing Drama Series), said Berridge "will now be involved in a major new drama project."
