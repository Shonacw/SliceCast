The Algerian Republican Guard is composed of about 6,000 troops.
It includes a horse mounted cavalry unit.
The cavalry detachment finds its roots in the mix of traditions of both the famous Berber cavalry, especially the Numidian cavalry and the equally famous Arab cavalry.
The Republican Cavalry's mission is to offer a stylish official display, mixing the Algerian nation's history, culture and traditions with a display of military discipline and professionalism.

The cavalry's ceremonial uniforms reflects the national colours and traditions of Algeria.
It consists of green Algerian trousers known as "saroual", red tunics known as "kamisa" or "kamidja", and long white capes known as "burnous".
These colours are those of the Algerian flag).
The troopers are also equipped with a traditional white headdress bearing the coat of arms of the Algerian Republican Cavalry, and a sword.
The mounted horses of the Republican Cavalry are all pure blood white-coloured barbs, equipped with a harness bearing the Cavalry's coat of arms, as well as a triple ponpon (white-red-green) on their heads.
