========,2,Career.
Nujabes was best known for his approach to hip hop beats, often blending jazz influences into his songs creating a mellow, nostalgic and atmospheric sound.
In addition to Japanese artists like Uyama Hiroto, Shing02, L-Universe, and Minmi, Nujabes collaborated with various underground American hip hop acts such as CYNE, Cise Starr (as a solo apart from the hip-hop collective CYNE), Apani B, Five Deez, Substantial, CL Smooth, Fat Jon, Terry Callier as well as British rapper Funky DL.
He was also a member of the production duo Urbanforest, an experimental collaboration with Nao T.
Nujabes was one of the most prolific contributors to the background music and soundtracks of "Samurai Champloo", an anime which blends a feudal Japan setting with modern anachronisms, especially in regard to hip hop culture such as graffiti and rapping.
Nujabes collaborated with Shing02 on the critically acclaimed "Luv(sic)" hexalogy.
They made parts 1-3 together, but after Seba's death many doubted that the series could ever be completed.
However, parts 4 and 5 had already been completed, and were released shortly after Nujabes' death.
Although part 6 was not among the previously completed tracks, it was released on February 26, 2013, 3 years after the day Seba had died.
According to Shing02's official Facebook page, the instrumental to what would eventually be part 6 was discovered on Nujabes' cell phone a few weeks after his death.

Frequent collaborator Shing02 has performed at many tribute concerts to the late DJ, and has remarked that "Through his soulful music, Nujabes has touched so many people around the world, even beyond his dreams", and "[I] deeply regret the loss of a unique talent and a close friend."
