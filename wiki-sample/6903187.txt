========,2,History.
Yeats indicated in a note that it was "an attempt to reconstruct an old song from three lines imperfectly remembered by an old peasant woman in the village of Ballisodare, Sligo, who often sings them to herself."
The "old song" may have been the ballad "The Rambling Boys of Pleasure" which contains the following verse:
The similarity to the first verse of the Yeats version is unmistakable and would suggest that this was indeed the song Yeats remembered the old woman singing.
The rest of the song, however, is quite different.
Yeats's original title, "An Old Song Re-Sung", reflected his debt to "The Rambling Boys of Pleasure".
It first appeared under its present title when it was reprinted in "Poems" in 1895.
========,2,Location.
It has been suggested that the location of the "Salley Gardens" was on the banks of the river at Ballysadare near Sligo where the residents cultivated trees to provide roof thatching materials.
"Salley" or "sally" is a form of the Standard English word "sallow", i.e., a tree of the genus "Salix".
It is close in sound to the Irish word "saileach", meaning "willow".
========,2,Musical settings.
The verse was subsequently set to music by Herbert Hughes to the traditional air "The Moorlough Shore" (also known as "The Maids of Mourne Shore") in 1909.
In the 1920s composer Rebecca Clarke (1886â€“1979) set the text to her own music.
The composer John Ireland (18791962) set the words to an original melody in his song cycle "Songs Sacred and Profane", written in 192931.
There is also a vocal setting by the poet and composer Ivor Gurney, which was published in 1938.
Benjamin Britten published a setting of the poem in 1943.
In 1988, the American composer John Corigliano wrote and published his setting with the G. Schirmer Inc. publishing company.
========,2,Recordings.
