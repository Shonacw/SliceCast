========,1,preface.
South Durham, formally the Southern Division of Durham and often referred to as Durham Southern, was a county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.
It elected two Members of Parliament (MPs) by the bloc vote system of election.
========,2,Boundaries.
In 1832 the historic county of Durham, in north east England, was split for parliamentary purposes into two county divisions.
These were the South division (with a place of election at Darlington) and North Durham (where voting took place at the city of Durham).
Each division returned two members to Parliament.
There were no parliamentary boroughs enclaved in the area of the South division, between 1832 and 1885, so no non-resident 40 shilling freeholders voted in the county constituency.

========,2,History.
In 1885 this division was abolished, when the North and South Durham county divisions were replaced by eight new single-member county constituencies.
These were Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Chester-le-Street, Houghton-le-Spring, Jarrow, Mid Durham, North West Durham and South East Durham.
In addition there were seven County Durham borough constituencies.
