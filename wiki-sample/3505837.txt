The city's name originated from the Telugu word "Gadapa" meaning threshold or gate.
It acquired this name with its relation to the Tirumala Hills; one had to pass through Cuddapah in olden days to reach Tirumala Hills.
In old Telugu the word Kadapa meant a threshold which in modern standard Telugu is evolved to gadapa while the city's name retained the old flavour.
It was spelled "Cuddapah" but was changed to "Kadapa" on 19 August 2005 to reflect the local pronunciation of the name.

The history of Kadapa dates back to the 2nd century BC.
The evidences of Archaeological Survey of India suggest that it started with Mourya and Satavahana dynasty.

In his period, Kadapa gained a lot of power and influence, which declined with his death later.
Telugu Cholas, were the next one to rule Kadapa.
Ambadeva ruled Kadapa in the latter half of the 13th century when he established the capital at Vallur, which is located at a distance of about 15 km from Kadapa.
After the death of Ambadeva, Kakatiya king Prataparudra II ruled until early 14th century.
Prataparudra was defeated by Muslims in the reign of Khilji emperor Alla Uddin.
Later in the mid-14th century, Hindus of Vijayanagar dynasty drove the Muslims out of Warangal and subsequently Kadapa and ruled for around two centuries till they were defeated by the Nawab of Golkonda.
The most illustrious ruler during this time was Pemmasani Thimma Nayudu (1422 CE) who developed the region and constructed many tanks and temples here.
