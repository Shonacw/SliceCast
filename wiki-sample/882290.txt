========,4,Kaplan Higher and Professional Education.
Kaplan Higher and Professional Education is a group of institutions that offer classroom and online certificate and degree programs in fields such as criminal justice, health care, business, information technology and legal studies.
Iowa College Acquisition Corporation, operating under the Kaplan University brand, also offers online programs.
Kaplan University specializes in online education, is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and holds other programmatic accreditations.
Most of Kaplan University’s programs are offered online, while some are offered in a traditional classroom format at 11 campuses in Iowa, Maine, Maryland and Nebraska, and four Kaplan University Learning Centers in four states.
At year-end 2013, Kaplan University had approximately 33,000 students enrolled in online programs and approximately 6,800 students enrolled in its classroom-based programs.
Due to student loan default rates, the U.S. Department of Education has criticized for-profit institutions, with the Secretary of Education asserting that "too many for-profit schools are saddling students with debt they cannot afford in exchange for degrees and certificates they cannot use."
For fiscal year 2009, Kaplan's students were more likely to default on their loans than their community college counterparts, with 17.3 percent of Kaplan University students overall not repaying loans on time.
In response, Kaplan Higher Education has set up the "Kaplan Commitment" program, which allows prospective students to attend the first few sessions of a course free, to decide if it meets their needs and abilities, before taking on a financial obligation.
The policy, however, is too new to reveal an impact on graduation and retention rates.
In October 2012, Kaplan closed nine of its campuses and consolidated four others into nearby locations.
Although the company did not give a reason for shuttering these locations, an August 2012 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that an accrediting commission had warned that its campuses in Baltimore, Indianapolis and Dayton could lose their accreditation for failure to meet student achievement requirements.
Loss of accreditation meant that Kaplan students would no longer be eligible for the federal student aid that makes up more than 80 percent of Kaplan’s revenues.
This occurred among growing negative publicity about for-profits schools who enrolled students who had almost no chance of succeeding in order to get their federal student aid.
Kaplan and the University of Phoenix announced new programs, offering some form of free trial to ensure that they enrolled only students who had a reasonable likelihood of success, which cut substantially into their enrollment numbers.
Kaplan University also includes the fully online Concord Law School, which is not recognized by the American Bar Association (which does not accredit online institutions), and graduates of the programs are eligible to take the California Bar Exam, given that it is the only state in which online law schools can officially register.
Also residing within Kaplan University is the School of Professional and Continuing Education (PACE).
PACE assists professionals in advancing their careers by obtaining professional licenses, designations, and certifications, including the insurance, securities, mortgage and appraisal licensing exams, and for advanced designations, such as CFA® and CPA exams.
PACE serves more than 3,200 business-to-business clients.
In 2013, approximately 500,000 students used PACE’s exam preparation offerings.

Kaplan was founded in 1938 by Stanley H. Kaplan, who started the business by tutoring students for the New York State Regents Exam in the basement of his parents' Brooklyn home.
He eventually opened locations around the country.
In 1984, Kaplan sold the company to The Washington Post Company, which centralized control.

In 2013 and 2014, Kaplan partnered with TechStars to create the Kaplan EdTech Accelerator, which hosted, mentored, and funded startup companies focused on education technology and product innovation for a three-month program in New York City.
The 22 startups that participated raised more than $15 million.
========,2,Lawsuit.
In 2007 Kaplan agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit that had been brought against Kaplan and BarBri, a company offering a widely used bar exam preparation course.
Among the allegations in the suit, which charged that BarBri had overcharged students, was an allegation of federal antitrust violation claiming that Kaplan had agreed not to compete in the bar review business while BarBri agreed it would not compete in the LSAT business.
Both West Publishing Company (parent of BarBri) and Kaplan denied the allegations and the matter was resolved without any findings of wrongdoing, with BarBri and Kaplan paying $30 million to the class claimants.
In 2015, Kaplan settled with the United States Department of Justice regarding allegations that it hired instructors who were not qualified.
289 former students of Kaplan will receive tuition refunds as part of the settlement, in which Kaplan admitted no liability.
