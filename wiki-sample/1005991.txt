The 1970 British Commonwealth Games (Scottish: Geamannan a 'Cho-fhlaitheis Bhreatainn 1970) were held in Edinburgh, Scotland from 16 July to 25 July 1970.
This was the first time the name British Commonwealth Games was adopted, the first time metric units rather than imperial units were used in events, and also the first time the games were held in Scotland.
Also, these games saw the first unique Games trademark logo: an emblem showing the Games emblem intertwined with a St Andrews Cross and a thistle.
They were followed by the 1970 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games for wheelchair athletes.
