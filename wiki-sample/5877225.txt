In 1879, she made her professional debut in the role of Josephine in Gilbert and Sullivan's "H.M.S.

She soon joined the Boston Ideal Opera Company and remained with the company as leading soprano for the next six years, singing roles in "The Marriage of Figaro", "The Bohemian Girl", "Fra Diavolo", "Giralda ou La nouvelle psyché" by Adolphe Adam, "The Chimes of Normandy", "Fatinitza", "Giroflé-Girofla", "Czar and Carpenter", and in Gilbert and Sullivan operas.
Ulmar next was hired to play Yum-Yum in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's first American production of "The Mikado", at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York, from 1885 to 1886, in a cast that included George Thorne (Ko-Ko), Courtice Pounds (Nanki-Poo), and Fred Billington (Pooh-Bah).
She joined a D'Oyly Carte touring company in England, singing Yum-Yum and Josephine for a few months, then Yum-Yum in the German company, before returning to America in the summer of 1886.
D'Oyly Carte released her to play for an American manager, John Stetson, at the end of 1886, for whom she played in Carte-approved productions in New York of "Princess Ida" (in the title role) and "The Mikado" (as Yum-Yum) and then in Boston in the title role of "Patience".
In early 1887, Ulmar rejoined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in England, where she rehearsed the new Gilbert and Sullivan opera, "Ruddygore" (later renamed "Ruddigore"), played Rose Maybud in two matinee performances at the Savoy Theatre, and then returned to New York to play Rose in the American production.
