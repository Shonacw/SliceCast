Whyville is extremely popular, and has a registered base of more than 7 million users.
Whyville's users (Whyvillians) engage in virtual world simulation based games and role play sponsored by a wide range of governmental, non-profit, and corporate entities.
Whyville was launched in 1999, by Numedeon Inc, which was founded by Dr. James M.

Whyville is regarded as an innovation leader in digital learning and online engagement of children.
Contributing to its educational influence, any of Whyville's citizens have stayed active users of the site for many years with significant impact on their lives and careers.
========,2,Whyville's interactive structure.
Whyville was one of the first virtual worlds built around learning games.
Whyville was also one of the first virtual worlds which used an internal virtual currency.
Users earn a 'clam' salary based on their educational activities on the site.
With these clams they can buy face parts, projectiles, furniture, bricks, and other virtual goods and services that enhance their life in the Whyville virtual world.
In 2007, Whyville partnered with the Spanish Bank Bankinterto build a virtual banking system for Whyville's users through which they manage their clam assets  Whyville was also one of the first sites to emphasize user created content.
Tied directly to the clam economy, once a user has accumulated a large enough clam savings, they can start their own Whyville virtual business based on their own created content.
Most of these businesses are built around the construction of 'face parts' from which users make their own avatars, using simple pixel by pixel drawing tools.
Other businesses design and sell decals for users' virtual Scions (virtual automobiles in Whyville sponsored by Scion owned by Toyota).
Players must draw their creations by hand.
There is no copying and pasting, and all contributed content is reviewed by site staff for appropriateness.
Since the site's launch, thousands of players have created millions of face parts.
A weekly newspaper called "The Whyville Times" comes out every Sunday.
Whyvillians send in articles that they have written to the Times Editor.
If the article is published, other users may comment on it in the Bulletin Board System (BBS).

In May, 2012, Whyville partnered with Power Across Texas, DaVinci Minds and Alamo Colleges to run the WhyPower Competition, a statewide class vs. class competition in the newly built WhyPower activity in Whyville.
110 classes competed to earn the most clams while building virtual green homes; managing power plant operations; placing wind turbines, solar panels and other power plants around Whyville; managing power physical infrastructure; and managing power policy for Whyville.
The winning classroom from the STEM RAM Academy, housed at Nimitz Middle School, San Antonio, amassed 57,984 clams.
