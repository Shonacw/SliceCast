Burleigh Waters developed in Stages, starting in the 1970s.
One section, Burleigh Waters Estate was a canal extension developed by Hooker Corporation with partner the BMD Group during the late 1970s.
The Hooker Corporation collapsed and Mr Power's BMD Group was paid out at 60c in the dollar a few years later.
Privately built homes were being constructed by the time Pacific Fair opened in 1977 and continued with the expansion of the suburb.
For decades a local urban myth maintained that sharks were seen as far south in the canal waterways as Burleigh Waters.
Alleged sightings and stories were locally spread, but balanced with scepticism.
