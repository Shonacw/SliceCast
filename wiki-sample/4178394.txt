As untouchables, they were traditionally considered outside the Hindu ritual ranking system of castes known as varna.
They are found mainly in the northern states of India and in Pakistan and Nepal.
Ramnarayan Rawat posits that the association of the Chamar community with a traditional occupation of tanning was constructed, and that the Chamars were instead historically agriculturists.
