In her early career, she did not specialise, and ran at many distances.

Her most successful season was 2002.
On March 2 at the European Indoor Championships in Vienna she beat local favourite Stephanie Graf and set the indoor world record at 1:55.82.
In the same year at the European Championships in Munich she became the European champion.
At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Čeplak finished very strongly in the 800 m but could not quite catch winner Kelly Holmes and finished with exactly the same time as Hasna Benhassi.
A photo-finish showed her in third-place, winning the bronze medal.
