Kowalchuk supported the creation of aboriginal schools in Winnipeg, as a means of promoting native self-improvement.
He supported a zero-tolerance policy against violence, and opposed budget cuts that reduced the number of counsellors and special-needs educators.
He also opposed the elimination of religious activities within the school system in 1991, saying "I have a big problem banning all religious activity.
They tried that in Russia 70 years ago and it didn't work".
He believed that it would be unfair to force students or staff to participate in religious exercises, but argued that the school system should allow "an opportunity for religious expression by various groups".
He was ultimately unsuccessful in this battle.
In 1994, Kowalchuk and other trustees defeated a motion which called for students to be taught lessons in tolerance toward people of different sexual orientation.
He described homosexuality as "abnormal", and suggested that counsellors be made available for children who believed they were homosexual.
Kowalchuk died on June 4, 2003, following a lengthy struggle with cancer.
