========,1,preface.
Hot box (or simply box) is a non-contact team sport which is similar to ultimate, but played on a smaller field and with fewer players.
Like ultimate, the object of the game is to score points by passing the disc into the end zone; however, in Hot Box there is generally only one end zone and it is of much smaller size than an Ultimate end zone.
In this way, hot box is a "half-court" (see basketball) variant of ultimate.
Because of these reduced requirements, it is often played when not enough players are available to play ultimate.
========,2,Rules.
For the most part, hot box follows the rules of play of ultimate.

========,2,Variants.
Many variations on the rules of hot box exist.
Common variants include changing the dimensions of the field, using a circle instead of a square for the clear line, a stall count of 5 or 7 (instead of 10), and a "no poaching" clause which prevents defenders from guarding the endzone instead of their assigned player.
Some variant games also exist.
Double box involves a short rectangular field with two small end zones rather than one; there is no clearing line, but when a team gains possession of the disc after a turnover they must attack the end zone that their opponents were not.
A variant originated in Washington, DC, Boot-Box, combines Double box with the cone hitting game, Durango Boot.
Two end zones are formed with a square of four cones.
Before scoring a team must complete a pass across a mid line.
They can then score at either end zone.
One point is scored for each cone knocked over.
Catching a disc and landing in an end zone scores 3 points.
Games are played to 15.
Invalidimate was developed in the UK as a way to include injured players in practice; the "invalid" stands in the goal and is the target receiver for both teams.
Two invalids can also be used in double box, with the additional rule that every player on a team must touch the disc (including the defensive invalid) before the offensive invalid can catch a scoring throw.
