The ABC Supply 500 is an Indy car race held at Pocono Raceway in Long Pond, Pennsylvania.
The race was sanctioned by USAC from 1971–1981, and then by CART from 1982–1989, and was known as the Pocono 500.
The race was removed from the CART calendar following the 1989 running, due to poor track conditions, as well as poor revenue for the promoter.
After a 23-year hiatus, the event was successfully revived by the Verizon IndyCar Series in 2013.
Following management changes at the facility, and after comprehensive safety improvements were completed at the track, the race was scheduled for Independence Day weekend.
For 2013, the race was scheduled for 400 miles, and was part of the "Triple Crown".
For 2014, the race returned to its traditional 500-mile distance.
The 2014 race, won by Juan Pablo Montoya, stands as the fastest 500-mile race in Indy car history.
At an average speed of , it was the first 500-mile race to be completed in under 2 hours and 30 minutes.

========,3,USAC.
The Pocono 500 began in 1971, as part of the USAC National Championship Trail.
It was part of USAC's "triple crown", consisting of the Indianapolis 500, Pocono 500, and California 500.
The race was popular, and the unique track layout was said to have been designed specifically with Champ/Indy cars in mind.
USAC sanctioned the event through 1981.
========,3,CART.
After organizational changes following the first USAC/CART "split," the Pocono 500 switched to the CART series beginning in 1982.
The race moved from June to August after the track added a second NASCAR Winston Cup Series race to their schedule.
Moving to August allowed the race to be distanced from Indy, and was set two to three weeks after the Michigan 500, giving teams more preparation time between 500-mile races.
The increasingly rough condition of the course made the race demanding, and sometimes led to high attrition and surprise winners.
Following the 1989 event, the track was officially deemed too rough and unsuitable for Indy cars.
The circuit still had metal boilerplate retaining walls, lacked catch fencing around the entire perimeter, lacked proper runoff areas, and was criticized for its roughness.
The Pocono 500 was removed from the schedule indefinitely, as neither track management nor series officials were interested in reviving the event.
Though the track safety conditions were the stated reason, track management also believed the event to be a money-loser for the facility.
Furthermore, according to CART medical director Dr. Steve Olvey, during the 1980s the track's medical facilities were grossly inadequate, with track owner Dr. Joe Mattioli himself listed as the "track doctor," despite his profession being dentistry.
========,3,IndyCar.
During both 2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races, heavy crashes on the Long Pond Straight sent circuit management to call for significant safety improvements to the track.
SAFER barriers were added to inside walls, catch fencing was installed around the entire perimeter, paved runoff areas were built around the majority of the infield.
The safety upgrades, as well as changes announced by the third-generation Igdalsky family (including repaving the circuit with new concrete pit stalls), led to discussions with IndyCar officials regarding the revival of the Pocono IndyCar race.
Speculation ran rampant in 2012 after the cancellation of the Indy Qingdao 600 that Pocono could have been used as a last-minute substitute.
However, nothing materialized.
On October 1, 2012, the track officially announced they would host the Pocono IndyCar 400 for the IndyCar Series on July 4 weekend starting in 2013.
The change in race distance was requested by broadcaster ABC.
For 2014, the race returned to its traditional 500 mile distance.
The three 500 mile "triple crown" race (Indy 500, MAVTV 500, and Pocono) would also award drivers double points towards the championship.
For 2015, the race secured the title sponsorship of ABC Supply Co., and was moved to its once familiar calendar slot in late-August.
In the 2015 race, driver Justin Wilson was struck in the head by a piece of debris which had flown off of Sage Karam's crashed car.
Wilson was airlifted to hospital but died the next day from his injuries.
In the summer of 2016, the track signed a contract extension through 2018.
