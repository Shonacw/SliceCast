========,1,preface.
"Pumps and a Bump" is a song by Hammer, released as the first single from his album "The Funky Headhunter".
The song was his last top forty hit in the United States.
========,2,Production.
In 1993, Hammer began recording "The Funky Headhunter".
To adapt to the changing landscape of hip-hop, the album was a more aggressive sounding album.
He co-produced this record with funky rapper and producer, Stefan Adamek.
While Hammer's appearance changed to keep up with the gangsta rap audience, his lyrics still remained honest and somewhat clean with minor swearing.
Yet, on this album as with previous records, Hammer would continue to call out other rappers who had dissed him.
It was produced by innovative musicians and writers such as Teddy Riley (who had previously produced records for Guy, Blackstreet, and Michael Jackson), The Hines Brothers, and G-Bomb.
It also featured Death Row Records head Suge Knight, R&B singer Aaron Hall, Whole 9 and Death Row recording artists Tha Dogg Pound.
========,2,Release and reception.
Hammer debuted the album and music video for "Pumps and a Bump" two months before its release on "The Arsenio Hall Show" and finally released it in March 1994.
"Pumps and a Bump" proved to be a controversial track on this album, somewhat affecting Hammer's image.
However, the single peaked at #3 on the US Rap charts.
It was banned from heavy rotation on MTV with censors claiming that the depiction of Hammer in Speedos (and with what appeared to be an erection) was too graphic.
This led to an alternative video being filmed (with Hammer fully clothed) that was directed by Clarksdale, Mississippi native Craig S. Brooks.
========,2,Pop culture impact.
During a mid-1990s appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show", talk show host Arsenio Hall said to Hammer, "Women in the audience want to know, what's in your Speedos in the 'Pumps and a Bump' video?"
A clip from the video was then shown, to much approval from the audience.
Hammer didn't give a direct answer, but instead laughed.
Arsenio Hall then said, "I guess that's why they call you 'Hammer.'
It ain't got nothin' to do with Hank Aaron" (which refers to the fact that Hammer was nicknamed after Aaron).
In 2010, American Idol contestant "General" Larry Platt sang a self-penned tune called "Pants on the Ground" that some in the media said sounded similar to "Pumps and a Bump".
