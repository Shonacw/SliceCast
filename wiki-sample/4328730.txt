========,2,Political activity.
In 2011, Bush released a video with the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) civil rights organization, calling on New York State to legalize same-sex marriage.
"'I am Barbara Bush, and I am a New Yorker for marriage equality,' she says in the brief message, sponsored by an advocacy group.
'New York is about fairness and equality.
And everyone should have the right to marry the person that they love.'"
Bush joined other children of prominent Republican politicians—including Meghan McCain and Mary Cheney—in endorsing gay marriage.
Bush's graduation from Yale in May 2004 was given heavy media coverage.
She and Jenna made several media appearances that summer prior to the 2004 U.S. Presidential election, including giving a speech to the Republican Convention on August 31.
The two took turns traveling to swing states with their father and also gave a seven-page interview and photo shoot in "Vogue".
Bush joined her mother on diplomatic trips to Liberia in January 2006 to attend the inauguration of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and to Vatican City to meet with Pope Benedict XVI in February 2006.
Unlike most of her relatives, Bush is not a member of the Republican Party.
In 2010, Jenna Bush Hager and Barbara Bush told "People" that they preferred not to identify with any political party, stating, "We're both very independent thinkers."
