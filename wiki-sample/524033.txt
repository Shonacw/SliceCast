Kilchoan ("Cille Chòmhain" in Gaelic) is a village on the Scottish peninsula of Ardnamurchan, in Lochaber, Highland.
It is the most westerly village in Great Britain, although several tiny hamlets lie further west on the peninsula (of these, the most westerly is called Portuairk).
The western linear, coastal parts of the village are Ormsaigmore and Ormsaigbeg.
Kilchoan altogether has a population of about 150.

Donaldson equates 'Buarblaig' (now Bourblaige about 3 miles east of Kilchoan on the other side of the eastern mountain of Ben Hiant at 528m, ) with Muribulg, where the Annals of Tigernach record a battle between the Picts and Dalriads in AD 731.
It may also be the 'Muirbole Paradisi' mentioned by Adomnán.
