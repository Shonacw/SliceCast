In the 1932 state highway renumbering, old Highway 132 was renumbered to Route 43 except for the northern end.
Route 43 ended at U.S. Route 7 in the village of South Canaan, instead of Falls Village.
The road to Falls Village became Route 126.
On September 11, 1951, Route 63 was extended into the town of Canaan using the northern portion of Route 43.
This resulted in Route 43 being cut back to its current northern terminus.
