========,2,History.
The origins of Aston University are a School of Metallurgy formed in the Birmingham and Midland Institute in 1875.
The Birmingham Municipal Technical School separated from the Institute in 1895, teaching chemistry, physics, metallurgy and electrical engineering.
In 1911, commercial classes were introduced and grew into an independent School of Commerce by 1916.
The school changed its name in 1927 to the Birmingham Central Technical College, to reflect its changing approach to teaching technology.
In 1951, the Technical College was renamed the "College of Technology, Birmingham" and work began on the Main Building at Gosta Green.
In 1956, it became the first elite designated College of Advanced Technology and underwent a major expansion.
It moved into buildings that were constructed between 1949 and 1955 to a design by Ashley & Newman.
Princess Margaret laid one of the first foundation stones at the base of the new building in 1951.
The building is one of Europe’s largest, freestanding brick buildings.
In 1955, the College of Advanced Technology was opened by Her Majesty The Queen.
The college expanded again to a design by the City Architect of Birmingham Alwyn Sheppard Fidler between 1957 and 1965.
It officially became the "University of Aston in Birmingham" on receipt of its Royal Charter on 22 April 1966 and the first Chancellor of the University, Lord Nelson of Stafford, was installed on 10 May.
The Charter of the University outlines objectives appropriate to a technological university: "to advance, disseminate and apply learning and knowledge by teaching and research, for the benefit of industry and commerce and of the community generally: and to enable students to obtain the advantage of a university education, and such teaching and research may include periods outside the University in industry or commerce or wherever the University considers proper for the best advancement of its objects."
The emphasis given to the sandwich course system, and the maintenance of strong links with industry, arises naturally from the institution’s history.
The motto of the University is the same as that of the City of Birmingham – "Forward".
Establishment of the Aston Science Park and Aston University’s contribution to the city of Birmingham was fully recognised when the area was granted its own postal address “The Aston Triangle” in 1984, emphasising the campus as an official district of Birmingham.
The logo of the establishment takes from the shape of the area.

========,3,Coat of arms.
The university's arms were granted on 18 March 1955 by Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms to the Birmingham Corporation, for use by the former College of Technology.
They were designed to show the College's connection with the City and with the teaching of technology.
The arms consist of a shield and crest.
The shield has two sections – the field (the main background) which is coloured blue and a chief (the broad band across the top of the shield) of silver.
On the field is a diagonal line of five gold diamonds joined one to the other, similar to the first quarter of the Arms of the City of Birmingham and incorporated in the Arms of the College to show its connection with the City.
This was adopted by the family of Birmingham which derived its name from the then hamlet of Birmingham, and provided the Lords of the Manor from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries.
On the chief is depicted an open book bound in red placed between two black hammers, showing the connection of the University with technology, the book representing learning and the hammers engineering and allied trades.
The crest is also designed to stress the pursuit of knowledge.
It consists of a red torch held erect by a forearm between two branches of gold laurel.
Having been originally worn on the helmet of a fully armed person, the crest is always placed on the top of the helm.
The method of joining the crest to the helm was usually concealed by decoration and, in the University’s arms, this is effected by the use of a wreath and a crown.
The wreath is silver, red and black, these colours being taken from the shield.
It is surmounted by a mural crown (resembling a wall), which is reserved in modern grants for persons and organisations connected with public corporations.
The cloth mantling which hangs down from the top of the helm is the survival of the cloak which was originally worn to protect the armour, coloured in the two principal colours of the shield, blue and gold.
