========,1,preface.
The Neil Young Archives is a series of archival releases by singer-songwriter Neil Young which feature previously released as well as unreleased studio and live recordings.
The project has been long in the making – work began in the late 1980s.
Throughout its development, Young himself has made several statements about the material included, release dates, and marketing that have proven false as the project is expanded upon to accommodate new releases or other relevant material.
Young has said that there will be five volumes covering approximately 50 years.
The archives are divided into several series.
The main part is a series of box sets covering separate periods of the artist's career.
The Performance Series consists of individual releases of live material.
Finally, there is the "Special Edition" series which will consist of previously unreleased albums.
These different series also overlap; since, for example, two volumes of the Performance Series are included on the first Archives box set release, but are also sold separately.
========,2,Box sets.
========,3,"Volume 1: 1963–1972".
The first volume, "The Archives Vol.
1 1963–1972", was released June 2, 2009, covering Young's early years with The Squires and Buffalo Springfield, as well as cuts, demos, outtakes and alternate mixes from his albums "Neil Young", "Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere", "After the Gold Rush", and "Harvest".
Also included in the set are several live discs, as well as a DVD of the long out-of-print film "Journey Through the Past", directed by Young in the early 1970s.
"Volume 1" was released as a set of 10 Blu-ray discs in order to present high resolution audio as well as accompanying visual documentation.
It is also available as a 10 disc DVD set and an 8-CD set.
On January 31, 2010, the box set won the Grammy Award for Best Art Direction on a Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package, and was shared by Neil Young along with his art directors Gary Burden and Jenice Heo.
========,3,"Volume 2: 1972–1982".
Young's manager Elliot Roberts said in 2009 that "Volume 2" would span 1972 through 1982, and would be released "two or three years" after "Volume 1."
In October 2009, Young told "Guitar World" that a disc called "Time Fades Away II" would be included in the second volume, noting: "It's interesting because ["Time Fades Away II"] has a different drummer than what was on that album.
Kenny Buttrey was in there for the first half, and Johnny Barbata came in for the second.
It's a completely different thing, with completely different songs."
Young has said that "four unreleased albums from this period are being rebuilt ... "Chrome Dreams", "Homegrown" and "Oceanside-Countryside" are the three unreleased studio albums.
Also from this period is the unreleased Odeon-Budokan live recording produced by David Briggs and Tim Mulligan".
In May of 2014, Young stated that "Volume 2" would be finished by the summer, and that the remaining volumes would be issued relatively quickly following the second.
In July of 2016, "Rolling Stone" and the Thrasher's Wheat website reported that Young intends to focus on completing "Archives Volume 2" after his tour with Promise of the Real concludes in October.
Although a physical release is still planned, it will involve a "high-resolution website" and will also include unreleased works entitled "Dume" and "Hitchhiker".
However, this material has been promised for years, and as of June 2017 there is still no actual indication that any of this will appear in the near future.
========,3,"Volume 3" (1980s).
Little information about "Volume 3" of the Archives has been announced.
However, the website for Young's "Living With War" album contains several live recordings of songs from "Life", which the page cites as being "From "The Neil Young Archives, Volume 3.""
