========,2,Ronald Rouse.
In October 2012, a lineman for the school's football team, Ronald Rouse, collapsed twice and ultimately died at the school's homecoming football game (he was revived and was able to speak after the first collapse and started walking, but could not be revived after the second collapse, and was declared dead at a nearby hospital) against a rival team from Crestwood High School in Hartsville, South Carolina.
An autopsy by Darlington County Coroner J. Todd Hardee revealed the ultimate cause of death as a fatal, sudden cardiac arrhythmia resulting from a congenitally enlarged heart (congenital cardiac hypertrophy).
There have been other sudden, catastrophically fatal incidents of cardiac arrest similar to this at high schools and colleges recorded in the U.S. in recent years, and the issue is beginning to receive more attention.
