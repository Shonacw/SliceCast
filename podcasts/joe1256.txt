I've went through martial arts the first time let me go back to I lived in student housing up until I was spent a teenager. Okay. It was a time when you bought one pay pressure 2 time and most of my values come from that Public Library open to swim in a public swimming pool. And my dad finished medical school I happened. I wasn't planned in the 50s that happened a lot and we had a lot a lot of patients who were kind of on the periphery of Pasadena, California, which is where we came as boring Indiana lived in Massachusetts. He was a resident grow up around the hospital's dinner make going to the hospital meet Dad and when we came out to LA Japanese were the peripheral Spanish-speaking people seriously enough in Holbrook running story. What was that? There were six Spanish-speaking people at UCLA and three of them were in garden. Not really that we're back in the 60s. That was today is Ali massive amounts of percentage, which it's kind of the first and a half now things have really changed a mental and I grew up in those neighborhoods to low riders. I've got a feeling I got a 51 Mercury that's chopped drop low and slow driving a bug with a Chevy engine a 383 up in the front. Where are they? Is she going to come on by harsh got to roll your r's horses drink a lot of you were listening in with five layers and gone hate fuck.

But I always trick first time I ever we were just playing with a sword there and that's not a summer. I swear that's like calling a 9 millimeter a police gun. Yeah, it kind is there used but that's a katana. We're playing with that a little bit first time. Somebody handed me. Those were with the Buddhist temple in Pasadena 19. You bet. I remember 1965 and there was a demonstration of the Japanese culture. Thank you and I came out and demonstrated, you know, the sword arts and stuff and then he shoots I'm going to take somebody from the audience and my Dad push me. And I walked out in the middle of that floor and held it here. Hold that sort just like you said. Wow, that's what is that 100 year olds or going to 1502 Wham oh, what am I hear something like this? First time I held that sir is like out of a graphic novel lightning in a Japanese for lightning. You went and lived until eyeglass my talk to you were living in Japan would do intend over there. You pitch a ball someday. I'm going to play for the Yankees. What was the wrestling? Grappling Sunday? I'm going to get in the middle of a Range Rover Rogue is going to say my name. And I'm working my way up to read Parker's American Kenpo system and someday I'm going to jpan. I don't want to learn from the guys who invented this stuff not putting on a pork barrel accent to make it entertaining but it did and I started exactly like I did and Barham Boulevard make it rock and roll with the my TV my Van Halen in the late 70s Garden Apartments in Midtown Tokyo. I did not know a single person. I didn't know a syllable of Japanese. I had no idea where I was and no I can't drive on the left side of the street. I barely carry yourself on character and a lifetime of Adventure. You do all the traveling come on artist to artist your home everywhere now, aren't you comfortable one in the room? What's there always is and that's what the most unsettling to the to the tourist Travelers? You're at home when you first start learning Japanese comes in three stages first you watch kids shows on television. Cuz they pronounce everything and nobody interrupts then you watch the news. Everybody speaks with a perfect accent bigger words, nobody interrupts and then you start going with me to the movies in the middle of the day on Tuesday and Tokyo Akins and you're the only pale face in the room. It's all in Japanese and it's the movies. Everybody's interrupting everybody shooting screaming Sirens airplanes going by and if you can begin to decipher even one character Then you'll develop ears baby. What do you know how to write it while you practice that certainly think of it as cross training. There are a lot of schools. For example a Hebrew school. You always hear about Hebrew school before you go to Bar Mitzvah class. It's an ancient way of wait a minute. Got to develop the side of your brain by correlating designs with language with meaning that may not actually be in nobody's walking around speaking Hebrew after all the only four Summers of what happened to develop that side of your brain to where you start to have a capacity to learn in accelerated which all your best musicians speak a couple languages where best politicians speak a couple ball your best artist Architects while your best design folks and stuff speak a couple of language. It's no secret that you develop that side of your brain. If your kids don't speak Spanish get after a language you don't I get every single day every like all that Ross University and Tokyo every morning 2 hours Japanese. Class B. Speaking the language I can get things done for you, but I'm not conversant write your follow. The end result is that it's crushed raining right long-term memory my short-term memory. Is Lil too short, but you'll see the difference in your ability to remember what you read to start remembering everything you see, so that's that's dangerous because of the fact that you're learning this new thing. So you're activating this part of your brain Hold Ya just started off with little kids and art class. For example, where you take a pencil and you guys just a pencil what else could it be on this environments are stick shift about that me I'm a hero and you can start to think in those terms using actual language. Movement same thing at this point in your career with jiu-jitsu and grappling. You have a vocabulary that starts to expand expand by having to learn and Challenge and challenge. People Marvel at Anthony Bourdain has biggest talent was to be at home everywhere. No matter what somebody might say or posture or present. He was able to Let It Go by when later or no will do it out right here and he had the capacity to stay cool in the middle of all of it. So maybe it's just a cool school when you think he just had a fascinating mine for travel and food and culture and he just wanted to know everything about how these people thought about the world and saw things differently. And if you're kind of feel bad now for people that don't travel I really do it's just I feel like that you're missing so much of what a human being is travel is a little bit perhaps like music or looking at art on the wall trying to have to have somebody teach you how to do it a little thing that like the fight game. Get really bored with technical boxing. It might be the best you've ever seen and it's not a slug faster prong. You have to explain. Well, she some jazz some jazz Conor McGregor's bitches. Brew are stained. What's the district use voice? Yeah, cuz you were there any jazz or United a jazz and I've never watched a lichen is background music, but I have a good friend. My friend. Alonzo bodden is a jazz Aficionado and he like host Jazz tours and stuff and he's a stand-up comic so he'll do it, and these things and he just loves it and you like lives for it. Well, I see the look on your face just because nobody taught you how to taste beer Computer Works in three parts in like it says in the Pickwick play. You don't taste it with a ship when you describe others to finish to the taste of a Cuban cigar. You mean when it's finished in the at know the Finish? Okay, Somebody explain these things to me or I need whiskey there's any in there is no eating in the world in whiskey for Scotch. Okay, that's simple short of starts at jazz music. Somebody explains it to you in very simple digestible Mount lofty necktie terms. Okay. I begin to understand a little bit of what's going on.

How do you get how do you spell and some guy I would explain Jazz tighten up for you? We'll do it in the Beatles style. Here's the best way to go for somebody new in interested the McCartney not in the Lennon and McCartney and I was always kind of happy.

There's a shadow within the last three nights. Neutron bomb is a little darkness is where you get that little a little bit of pepper in the chocolate you it's a little it's a little Melancholy any life like that. And when you put them together doesn't sound like they do but if I could I'd sing both parts and it goes together you go. Wow, Bittersweet like my fucking career going to have to listen to Jazz like your taste want the best for this phone is Monk and he's working these days you can tell is it happy or sad? I don't know how was dinner last night? Ratchet happy that's Disney. It's not just sad, you know, somebody who's always truly in. His guitar to sad There are some folks Leonard Cohen since past is what sounded more like I know what you mean same here. I get I rarely show. Okay, then maybe that's a baby boomer thing.

Yeah the whole world and everything. I have the whole thing had to sit on me and hold me down, but I'm not going to kid you it was a trial would imagine it's much more painful to do with that. I think what happens is tattoo when you get something that stings you can take it for a while. It's the distance that counts you can take the cold for 30 seconds and miserable cold. Are you doing the cryo dunk? But try holmat out in front of you for 15 seconds kind of never really do show your tattoos anywhere that's not part of the show. It's not part of but behind the scenes.

You have a Rembrandt on your body's probably more expensive than the paint job on your car driving a Ranger series for sure about it cuz it's forever, right? 64 doctor says 64 is the new 94 me. And I believe it'll take my word for him a little farther down range than a laddie. I can tell you what I see from here. You look great if you wait until you're 55 to start hitting the weight stack. You will look like a 55 year old who trains three times a week if you start when your two digits old. Yo for Yayo. Moving. Oh, yeah, you start way early. When did you start the tattoos? I got my first one in 1977. All right came back from a Delirious a trip to the West Indies and a handful of folks that were camping out on the beach. I'm a combat hippie. Okay, peace love and heavy weapons case. They want to feel the love camping, new style somewhere in the West Indies and we all came back out of seahorse on the on the ankle. Oh boy. Yeah, I waited, you know most today what's popular for example Hispanic style you you use a badges. Blackish document something. Here's a name or something. We got when we went on spring break or something. And when we got married you build like a miracle and I waited to do the whole thing in One Sweep, you know, thinking in terms of plans. So I waited until you know, I was well past that I was celebrating my 60th birthday, but I got about three hundred hours and I and still Outdoors. I'm still bouncing around and there's nothing out there. I've been climbing. I started off at Joshua tree and climbing out of tockets in the seventies did now how I wasn't Alex Honnold just on the sheriff for flavor of the week the first time when Studio 54 was happening at the same time. I just bought a Winnebago It look like something from Breaking Bad is living in his van part of me always looks back at that.

It's wow sleeping in the back of Bobby hatches pickup truck parked out in the middle of nowhere in Joshua Tree 1973 and you would be climbing even back then equipment. Did you guys use pectin the same stuff they use today. Nothing like it. We used webbing for our new and used a 11 mm. Kernmantle or Manila rope. All right, and I remember the first time since 1972, you'll see his name John bald and pioneering a lot of the routes in. Joshua Tree first time we watch him as seniors in high school go flagging you know, where you pressure. What can you see this and Screen there where you pull with your hands and push with your feet flagging all the way up the corner of a handball court at Muir High School in Pasadena all the way up to the top and then stood on the top and looked down showing incredible. Wow. Well 9 incredible talents. We've never seen such a thing and from that point, you know, we just floored it because living in up in Yosemite in the various parts was something new traveling to Joshua tree tockets down to the beaches and such that was a constant for me. I've always tried to follow something as opposed to thinking of his training in the even word training taste like homework, so I've always tried to I was running. For a long. Of time is about 7 years when I jogged and ran and I decided on the road. I'll run across every bridge in America that we tore through so I probably 15-20 different Bridges Golden Gate Brooklyn. That's where I ran now. I just smoked a joint and run the New York City marathon. And I came in right behind the wheel chairs in the back and they need to see the clock and everybody clapping and then there's some folks, you know, who just just wanted to Jim Croce and they took down the clock but the line was still there on the cement in Central Park hopped over the line got the picture Airborne went home took a nap and that night. I went out and got drunk on tequila. How long does it take you to finish the marathon in about five and a half hours? That's not bad. That's very good. It's better than nothing at the worst. Yes. That's about the absolute worst that you what's the winter do it our 20? I think they get it in the round 2 hours. They were like 2-hour Mark and 7 Seconds. Yes. I think you're trying to break 2 hours. Is that what's going on? Someone's trying to break 2 hours. So but that's what I did for a. Of time. You know, she just always been involved in physical activities that were fun in the early nineties kayaking was illegal in Manhattan. Because it was dirty water and people would get trundled all over under the ferry boats. So what we did is we cut a hole in the fence next to the 14th Street sanitation department over by the West Side Highway. Y'all know what I'm talking about if you're from there and we did it exactly like movie style like Great Escape where we fit in the fence back with duct tape and we would drag our kayaks from Union Square West all the way down 14th Street. Okay, and you pick up your Provisions for it. All right. Got to get your bagels. She got to get you that's what you know like this. You got to get something to drink get some Gatorade, you know, not to drink the Gatorade. So you have something to Wiz you sure we get the girlfriends. Okay to wait up is in the Meatpacking District, right? There's dead silent was a ghost town then it was not hip hop. It was not going. Which is what it's doing now and you go to shopping with your old lady at 6. Delan McCartney down there not been as Ghost Town. That's great. Scary dangerous. I got to be careful with names. They're all married. If the cops come they would step out we would see them whatever and we would sneak our boats to the hole in the fence into the river right where Sully landed is playing right there. Right and the girls will come and jump in the boat and we would take off more than two or three times local PD would show up that water back then that was that was death Inky black horror death of Duncan. It accidentally did not in that River particular, but we Started a number of the trips today. You just probably six different kayak clubs that you can have Manhattan kayak Club in Brooklyn clock now the Boomers with senses of humor figured it all out. All right, and we would go just we started Trish we go at midnight under the Verrazano Bridge in the winter. Alright anywhere drysuits something, you know your long and Long John's inside of a dryer sheet like this. I would be the DJ. I have a Hey ya tape player and I would like to take player like this and everybody would have this primitive X is 19 yearly 90s and we would have little microphones in the ear pieces that you use on motorcycles back then so you have communications from boat to Bow Wow, and I would put mine on the tape player and I'll be the TJ to the Ballgame late at night. Sometimes she didn't you hear laughing all you could see anybody in the swell and we go under the same bridge that John Travolta sits and looks at with the girlfriend in Saturday Night Fever Cambridge. Analytica Woody Allen in Manhattan looks at you. You ever wonder what's on the other side is terrible imitation of either Full Moon Midnight February snow drifting like this and since it was illegal to do it. We had a buddy won't a plumbing company Brooklyn and he would bring his truck and park it right off of Coney Island near Stillwell Avenue where the ferris wheel is and he would blink his lights Allied Forces style like that and we'd be about a quarter-mile off having come from under the Verrazano bridge, but why don't we see those lights blinking nowhere to turn left? Do you want to hear this guy? Okay, we have to make the left and we wait for the swells are going to give us another blank when tall was clear and Josh. Quarter mile row row row Catch the Wave get out of the boat. Silently drag it all the way up the beach. Okay, like you see in every war movie about $200 or something like that and we would put the boats big two-person kayaks into the back of the plumbing truck and on the top of a drive it back to the coffee shop on Union Square West very well-known like that and get drunk with pretty girls and tell him about adventure stories and all this is going on while you were you were air quotes David Lee Roth. This is the nineties. You're a fucking huge. You're still a rockstar and you're going through polluted water in a fucking kayak hiding from the cops and put a tape player. And if it's some sort of jury-rigged microphone, so some of the best places that I went rock climbing on walls of hotels in Europe with Tasha Latasha rope out that Third floor of a bed and breakfast in San Sebastian Spain discovered from flagstone with flagstone from the 1400s like that. And then yoyo one guy would stay up watch TV and work to buy a way. You can climb up the outside Jesus Christ hardcore jollies. So you were doing this all around the same time Outdoors is in the blood, you know, it's part of growing up without any real things. My dad was a student. So take this stick for you. It'll be about him for me. It'll be a bit.

When did you start working as an EMT the same time wasn't it was about twelve summers ago for me. So I was turning 50 and I started going back to school for outdoor Med response camping climbing. And what what is it? Like when you go to one of those classes and they realize who you are is a cat sometimes you can get a little bit uptight cuz I'm the oldest guy in the room who can write it and I want to clarify something when I became an EMT. Field number 327-466-4073 shank big shout out to all of you who taught me and tolerated me until I became an EMT and put on their uniform. I wasn't somebody. Somebody clean the fucking truck up until I put on that uniform show after training for how many months is almost here for me like this. I wasn't someone someone clean up the truck and that was my job. But I was also the somebody who dragged the oxygen box off 13 floors up in the eaten wall projects an artist to artist how many times have you driven past something whether it's a huge building or a teepee? What you do and then you go under my wonder what's in the refrigerator? I wonder what they listen to in there, and I wonder who they are. I have a Fascination for that my pop had a big sprawling empathy for people, you know, when the fellows started getting age in the early 80s, you started treating them you saw a surgeon and everybody my sisters and stuff started saying but this is a time when you think you catch that shift from breathing it pop and whatever he turned to me. I'll never forget you should I don't get to choose my patients. Well, I don't get to choose my ideas. What was the motivation to start doing that though? What's we'll see what's in there frigerator Joe and you'll walk in first cuz you're way stronger than me in case there's trouble and you'll go ambulance in case somebody comes that I should you handle it. Oh, I had a I had a mentor name Keisha who had to pile are dreadlocks up. So hot that it was as long as from her shoulders to the top of her head for haircut like she had since you put her hat up on top and Keisha walk in that door first on me. Yeah, those are scary as hell and you get an eye on your audience stops being audience starts being the neighborhood pretty sure you live in the neighborhood. I wish I could the train Once In The Fulton Street Station talking to a homeless valid quick briefing act like nothing's wrong shipping get them come out. Hey. Yonkers train breathe Okay subway team Breeze. Don't just sit there silently grilled cheese. I'm laughing now that that's a nervous laugh and now every one of those folks has in my voice when I sing. I like that. I like that thought process when you decided to do this. What is a conscience a conscious effort to try to Justine Rich your experiences cross-training cross-training. I'll give it a quick rationale. And I also know it's going to change me don't know how but got to get in it and after a certain point in your life, maybe go where there is no shallow and challenge yourself as just as I move somewhere. That's a foreign languages. You can't even read the street signs in Japan for example, but you know, she can you start off on the bunny slopes. You don't surf 40 Footers right away at first you got to move to New York go through that whole thing of what have I done but what's so what's that song? What's this when you like I'm going to be an EMT. I'm going to study for a year and a train. I'm going to go out there and actually do it. Okay, sometimes when I go for a walk in the city, my plan is just follow where the sun is beaming I get to an intersection to son is on that far corner. I'll cross over to that and then I'll look down the block and see where the sun isn't I'll walk down the block and get into that part definition of islands by yourself. I did the same thing with EMT training. My dad was a doctor the First Merit Badge I got is a Boy Scout was first day. I wish I got and I have learned that for skinny guy like me real power probably came from being cool and everybody else is gone. Yeah, cuz my dad had to do that I assisted him in surgeries at a very early age and you know and stuff that made everybody else like this Papa. I have a good ambulance noise. You want to hear it? Let me know that. You're going to be just fine to Maginot being in an ambulance in look up and it's motherfuking David Lee Roth tell me you're going to be okay. Like I'm dead. I must be dead. Only twice has that actually happened cuz I only worked in the hood only worked around it at night. I only worked she don't you would never expect to see me once was after Ozzfest drank too much or whatever. He was out of sorts and then somebody found in men from a local liquor store and you could see it at this point in his face. You know what I weighed over now and said, you're going to be just fine just like the lyrics of an Ozzy song come to life, but beyond that nobody ever really did, you know 15 more pounds I was doing the Arnold routine at the weight stack cuz I was somebody will somebody help me lift this I'm not pretentious about what my Fortes work. So you booked up for the job. Oh, yeah, and I wait 15 more pounds and I lift it bad. I could lift. I look at people out of bathtubs. I lifted him out of the ocean. I lifted him out of the projects. I went through them out of the truck. I would get him into the other truck was the first truck just broke down in the snow. And justice for all sorry, I want to do this for I restarted once about four-and-a-half Summers for nephews. Okay playing and what ever going to get a big shout out to all my teachers and mentors not a day goes by I don't think about it and not a day goes by that. I don't use some skill including that, you know, that'll level your head a little bit. Somebody go make some coffee Joe. So you feel like for a guy like you were such a gigantic Superstar and you just touring these huge Arenas and people are freaking out every time they see you for you. It was maybe a good way to balance things out too because you're seeing people in a life-or-death situation and Dire Straits when they're unhealthy and they need help and and you're out there in the down and dirty in the nitty-gritty like, you know, like you said trucks breaking down. Can people buy the bathtub so will a lot of what you just described is the First Response Team? Yes, we always described our patients are friends and clients. Okay. But the struggle for our I'll called the uniform starts with military police fire first response. I'll throw in nursing emergency room in those of us with bells and whistles and she called the ambulance and you see that from the inside out. Yeah, and that really will sharpen your vision. Okay. I'm free sample right off the bat. I pay 52% in taxes. Just turn my Dollar in half half for many many years, I'm all for tripling police fire medical paramedic emergency nursing cetera like that starting pay should be about $2,500 a week. And I'm so hungry. I would pay more tax happily. I would too if that case would be and we would take what is a very Set of very refined sciences and art forms everything. I just described it call it the uniform because we put on a uniform we go to work in there like that. It's time to go digital. And you can start making real demands in terms of just a preparation your follow-up today being on the beach taking care of people whether you're in First Response medical or answering fire calls is on par these days you have to make the decisions of a seal team wears same training. Where's the same gear? I went to Palm Springs international school for tactical medicine out there in the fellas. We had game wardens from Alaska we had heavy rescue Cleveland. We had all manner of folks coming through there and they all discuss. Well, sometimes we have to share one helmet Black sometimes we don't have enough guys to do this and that so we just park the car and let him think there's something these kinds of stories and you start paying people what they're worth and start paying people according to what your expectations been a lot of things.

I don't go political that nonsense like Charlottesville and what's happening in a lot of areas ready States will go by the wayside from no qualifications necessary to a man you guys work just as hard and you endanger yourselves weigh more than a trial attorney. I personally got out of jury duty recently by saying I didn't want to get out of jury duty. In fact, I raise my hands when the judge does anybody here think they can do jury duty. You're all trying to get out of it and I raise my hand. If you should watch it because I now can see that there are neighborhoods where everybody is. I know of neighborhoods where everybody's a liar a cheat a crippled and if they're not they're covering for somebody and she said what neighborhood is that? I should never go community in Beverly Hills. Did the sale of almost dropped his gun? Everybody was laughing they dismiss me to opinionated too much life experience. Don't let the door hit in the ass on the way out if yep. Have you ever done jury duty? If I if I did get in there, I probably just tell them I think everyone's guilty. Clean up cap sizes when you walk into the room and you know, everybody's lying. Not really. I mean, I probably should do it soon probably get experience for me. I keep showing up last time I actually showed up a fellow. He was a driver's two guys who were being accused of shooting somebody while Shepherds watched faintly Slavic Europa James Bond movies everybody message to call. Kind of a thing. Where you playing next year in Pasadena at the house all the time there. Do you have a Vibe about the ice house? Is there a Mojo to it oldest comedy club in the known universe that that place has been in operation since the 1960s? It was originally an actual ice house. We're back before the refrigeration. They would bring a nice and people go to buy ice it have a gigantic in a freezer type room was insulated. So keep the ice for a long time. Then it became like a variety type play and it's somewhere in the sixties. It became a comedy club and it is now the oldest longest running comedy club in the world. 1973 I was working as a janitor / Tech in surgery at Hospital Pasadena night shift their Alicia Keys. We did everything it was the stepping stone to go into medical school. And I was playing acoustic guitar. Can I still take lessons playing acoustic guitar and on Sunday nights audition night, you would sign up for audition at the ice house at 6:30. They open the window and you would sign up. So I take my dinner break and drive my old book at that station wagon up to the Ice House get there in about 6:15. Wait, they pop the window sign up so that I would be one of the first 3 to audition after the last act on Sunday night, which would happen right around 10. If you weren't one of the first three during audition night and nobody was there and then they shut it down. I would sign up go back to work. And then, you know drive myself back change out of my Hospital stuff. Put on the right clothes for my jeans or whatever and I audition there probably 15 times Bob stain owned and ran. The place was just a voice over the intercom. So unforgiving Bob was a famous non Smiler. What's funny is there's a bob that owns it. Now Bob Fisher couldn't be more different the nicest guy in the planet Earth always smiling hugging everybody super sweetheart of a guy call. Bob stain was a voice over this year copy was Hardcore, you know, if I need to go. Well, here's a little song and the voice would say hopefully it's a little earlier than the one preceding it. Is there any work your traps according to Bob? He was your Is your Ike Turner and if you felt your song was too long of your your roof in between as you know, he called you out. If you didn't like your shoes, you talked about it. You never saw him. You heard it over the PA or while he was in the back is quite a dishwasher and I learned a tremendous amount about I communicate with it where the crap out. How do you talk to people as one? How do you make eye contact? What in fact or the wrong shoes? What are the rock shoes platforms got back in the day in your platforms. That's right. Whatever happened to David Lee Bowie. Are you the same David Lee Bowie? It was your this over the over the PA system in Kiss performs today. Do they still wear platforms? I think it's in the contract you I was part of the outfit Mcenroe has to yell at you got to be fucking kidding. I never thought of that like they might be the last band thats wearing platforms until a wow. Everybody likes to make fun of platforms bell-bottoms sideburns till they come back around. I don't know about platforms on guys, but on the right girl on the right girl for a while that suggests different time frames, right? That's the twenties. That's the thirties that could be the seventies. You know, there's something about those kiss ones though. That was like they're inexorable, right? They're part of the gig liked with Gene Simmons. He's got demon boot so you that they're still rocking them. Wolf costumes DIY digital they're definitely new and improved. I like the boots. I like it man. That is got to be fucking hell on your knees though. That's got to be hell on your lower back there all the above and I'm going to leave it had blood Stanley's still in shape. So he's cute looks great. He was here a couple years ago where I fail. I should have gone kiss Blue Man Group years ago to those of you who are my age Lassie there should be four of me. Oh, that's the move right? Because yeah, right. No one can tell her I said sing like you can replace a lot of those guys and if you didn't tell anybody in a long someone ever heard the Japanese gentleman that he does a Steve Perry impression. He's the new lead singer for Journey Philippines message an interesting subject. Perhaps compels it are some bands like West Side Story where you can continually Revitalize the production different actor it with different actors. Okay whole lot of Shakespeare going on. Yeah, okay.

But you have to kind of replicate the initial sound or do you think I'm sure all of Beethoven's earlier orchestras your dad dinner's ready just because I don't think you can say this because this is a part of my youth Van Halen was a part of my youth. I mean we used to Judah the Van Halen logo on our notebooks and high school long with the Rolling Stones like the mouth and you know, the KISS logo when it's switched over to Sammy Hagar it became a different thing. It was a different. There's a whole different pivot mean it wasn't it wasn't a bad thing. I know she all Shams lyrics contain love guess. Okay Why Can't This Be Love and I ain't talkin bout love more fighting after this job. I was a different. I don't I run was my running partner. Yeah, run with the devil. Hello. Okay, I want you going. Okay. Should I jump should I jump? Yeah, I mean come on and love are a great classically. That's Sinatra, but I'm I'm not well adjusted. Nobody in my job ever was much I kept it this long and I faced it embraced it. All right there in the lyrics. Yeah using what are considered classic music parlor tricks taking a very sad lyric and positioning it against a very happy piece of music. The music is robbing. It's it's it's heavy metal Rumba and she's crying. Yeah James crying didn't notice that it's if there's a there's a sense of larceny. Is it chaos to it in the lyric? There's a sense of music for after midnight when we're all guilty Joe. Yeah, we're as it again. Nothing wrong with the Sammy Hagar thing, but it moved into a mall crowd. It was a different sort of a Vibe. It was it was a good vibe for a lot of folks, but it was a different vibe. I mean, I don't have anything against Sammy Hagar things wonderful always loved that song Can't Drive 55 is got some great shit, but I never will listen to the Van Halen with Van Hagar. I just didn't listen to it to me. It was like I was at end of an era for me. It's two different folks. Yes. I wanted to be your project not just wear one. So by placing my everything we've discussed if you think of it as cross training pants gray trash now, why'd you do that? And then you did this and why it's Crash trains going to read and form your sound is going to be informed the way you are on your stagecraft. How you even walk. On stage 2 choice of what to wear to follow your sense of humor, especially. Well, that's a great way to look at what you were talking about with the West Side West Side Story analogy because it kind of went on but it kind of didn't it's like if you took West Side Story need change the story you can't change the story but you can change the voices. Okay, but it would be a different story like the Van Halen story became a different story right here. I'll Venture this. Okay, one of my favorite freeze-dried bands in history is Toto freeze-dried will all freeze dried coffee looks the same. Okay, I've been camping and man. There's nothing better that I just a cup of fresh freeze dried Goods in the ruin the wrongest places. That's fun some contacts. It's the best thing you could ever have got to have a good song by shaed amazing. So amazing Smithsonian level song. Okay Rosanna and so forth and I wouldn't recognize him know, you know I said, I would not recognize them and say is the greatest genius in all of music in that regard Steve Miller. Nobody knows who the fuck Steve Miller as state of all jet airliner some every Human Solutions songs, and if you stay a few even start to play do-do-do-do do-do-do-do getting ready to tangle love me. God damn. He had some jams then there are artists. Where you just can't replace it Rod Stewart. One of the best uncles in history of Yahweh is probably Rod Stewart. Yeah, okay his songs you can have other people seen them but in something other now journey, I would recognize the guitar player, but that's just listen to that kind that part of the band. Okay on my favorite part of the orchestra is too gone. But Steve Perry sing for Journey was not so much a personality is an eloquent sound vs. So it's a universal sound and if you even get close to it, Appreciate is part of every prom every wedding every going in and coming out party. Okay, if you are going into the into the army, that's the last song the band's going to play you're coming out of jail. They're going to your girlfriend's going to put it. Throw your back to the side and runs just seen the movie. Yes. Even Tony Soprano. We're not sure what happened, but it happened to Journey. Yes true. That's right. Okay, that's Jerry significance. You can't play a David Lee Roth Sean and still worried about Tony Soprano. That's true half of your mind is going to go wait a minute. The lawn Ranger just walked into the same Diner that Tony's so I have no acting career. I'm already a character. Lone Ranger sits down. Next uses Joe. There's a forest. It's a dark Forest you not get lost in any stories in your legs. Go this too. Fucking Lone Ranger. Right? Right. Right, right a good actor. Is it time to go dark for us to do some people can become then other person. Oh, yeah, and then some people are stuck being David Lee Roth David Dave doing in a spacesuit, right? Exactly. Yeah, we're not buying it. I'm already kind of cultural. Yeah, you already know that you're already a thing. Yeah, that's it. That's all that's really interesting how there's all these great bands with great sounds and great Vibes and they're all different. If you think in terms of the personality, let's think of a band cold. I just saw John Mayer great show. All right, and when you think of John you think of who that is in the neighborhood in the vibe and the mood before perhaps you even think of a specific slot as soon as you know, I know his hats I know his songs, but it was the same thing that the fellas in the Grateful Dead who said they're identifying that vibe. What's more important the jokes or the person? What's more important you or specific jokes? Cuz some of your jokes are bound of a go flat-out carrots job. Yeah, but some of the the only way they were some of them the way they work is with you like a sub be like Mitch Hedberg is perfect example, like you couldn't separate Mitch Hedberg from the jokes cuz he was the jokes. He was part of what made it funny. You're right. I ran into Jeffrey Ross the other day Okay, and he did Mike punching a telling who is managing them. That's a movie to happening those two, right? That's wild. Samantha lemon fortune cookie is it is they were walking around in the park doing warm-up for their routine, you know, the Netflix special handling. I think that's a tag. I think though that with guys like that especially those two guys. The best product is them on stage and then fucking around you really don't want to make a movie. Just want to keep doing what they're doing with Netflix dishes de visita Vibe you have them be there's there's some folks like Jason Strahan. There's always Jason and this is what compels me. Some folks are very joke dependent not take my wife. Please yourself. Is the audience that you see when it's like at the comedy club senior at the comedy club the same audience is fight night times. Yeah. Yeah. It's real similar in a weird way. I was weird. I see that I see George Michael eyebrows when he was trying to figure it out, you know, it's weird cross over but what makes it weird for what's weird that I do cage fighting commentary and stand-up comedy in the first place. It's weird that those two things work together. All that doesn't that doesn't know that makes perfect sense for you, but you're a wish I just shared with somebody. I'm funny not happy. Yes money. You ain't happy. There's a big difference happy you you are the better the funny really think so absolutely railing if you know how to channel it is certainly the case in some situations. I'm open to all possibilities. When it comes to Comedy, I know people that have really happy and really funny and I are people that are really dark and also really funny. Like I don't know. It's just it's different. It's different with different people just like music is different with different bands different singers fix the city either works or doesn't really depends on how much time and effort you take working on yourself your act your perspective. Will you deliver it? We always had to win in Van Halen. We had no choice I had to win the battle of the band was competitive. We had to win over the club owner. This was before there were dance system Cerwin Vega hadn't in 10 figured out those bass bins yet. You had to have a life and 5 45 minute session. I please see a motherfucker close or song or you knew a band couldn't go on a LaGrange. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we're pretty good at anything. We had no development phase. I have tapes of us at the Hilton hotel in Pasadena 1973 you would if I didn't tell you with you and think it was 3 years ago. Why kind of Ash and there's virtually no development had that happened. How did it work that way? We had classical training right in this kind of speech to what we were discussing earlier and that a lot of my colleagues are having a great time making music and they celebrate and it's the word fun comes into it and we grew up in classical music backgrounds where you had to challenge for first-year saxophone every 6-8 months. You got to go to the conductors that I want for his chair and if your first share and he thinks I have a shy guys going to come over to Joyce's Ross talk about you you both debugging to play this piece. The orchestra next Wednesday, you best practice. Okay, and we'll both get both play 18 bars of the same piece you dig there just may be a switch in front of 120 people all of them colleagues or right we learned from in music school get out. The racy stuff was big band. All right, if your we play rock and roll in parallel, but big band it's got a square vibe to it because it went up in elevators and restaurants and whatever but they had cutting conscious there was nothing more cutting than Benny Goodman vs. Chick Webb big band at Roseland Ballroom. That shit is on people would bet on it. They would play the same for songs. You play your version of it and we'll play ours. Yeah, I feel right. Now throw down a big band Throwdown. Oh, yeah, and it was Furious and you know, it wasn't like friendly guy right there were serious and in the middle of those. Okay, and the dancers were competing the Lindy Hoppers could be Switch competitive and we learned that's how you do it. You know my true mentors in music first and second chair clarinet the LA Philharmonic and becomes from that. Also, do you know you have a whole different vibe glitch? I'll take a Grateful Dead approach which is the complete opposite of that competition man weave that at home bro, and I completely understand that's where I'll go aft work. Well for all of our shows sell food in the parking lot man. We had to win we are we didn't eat boxing for money different than boxing for fun right very early and we learn through music. Yeah, you know some of the folks learn it in the ring and other folks learn it and their first few days in a law firm or and they join it to the way you described it with music because I try to explain that the comedian's I say think about how much time a musician has to spend practicing and how little we spend practicing we are practices. Front of the audience for the most part it's a simplified version of a simplified version of the how many hours rule is the 10,000 hour you've heard about. Yes, that's very simplified version cast digestible 10,000 hours. I don't know you break that down six years. Maybe some wind is the true Asian Paradigm is 10 hours a day every single day for 10 years. If you have a little a little kid, he's got to have heart surgery. You want that guy rides right around 30,000 hours? If you're going to go flying in a helicopter over New York City, you want Captain polytrim on tonight? That's about 40,000 hours. Can I pay my dentist? Dr. Glassman who teaches is a $40,000 man? So if you ever crash or get belted, give me a call. I will hook you up. All right, it's about 30000 hours. And that's 10 hours a day every single day for 10 years. And that's what creates a Jet Pilot a great surgeon a great writer. Yeah, anything in the Arts and letters that's that's the architect unless you're up Prodigy and you can fungal that and typing is tragedy very easily. So yeah, Prodigy's and tragedies off and go hand-in-hand something about people that get things very easily that for whatever reason slip through their fingers more quickly as well. When my Shish my dad was an eye surgeon. Can I did well in with my sisters wanted to go to college you should I think that's a great idea and made her pay for it would evaluate if she didn't pay for yourself. It's probably right that signed my first contract when I was $1,350 stereo and a 3 records. I worked all summer shoveling shit at the local or State trailer in Spanish. I don't know that you got to do that. You are the same thing from Sports. Yeah, your kids dish Sports martial arts. And one of them is really in a gymnastics. What are they do they enjoy themselves? Are they on team? Like they're turned our tournament inshore. And is that something that the get-go here? I'll back up. I'm leading up to something. Can I guess yeah. Can I think you always are starting to take the getting-ready more than the actual show really natural show. I'm making fun here. I'll be a poetic but the monitor blows the guitar players pissed. Guy, I have a cold but that's 6 weeks 6 weeks leading up to it. I remember the rehearsal we did everything and it right when we recorded the track over there. Remember when we got measure for the shoes that fucking that's correct. And it's where can we eat after that? I got to go back to whatever as memorable as possible because you can do a whole lot more I getting ready. Then you are throwing the punch ask anybody on one of your shows. Yes. Yeah, you know you have such a great insight for that though. I know some people think that maybe even if they're aware of it or not consciously aware, but they're not focusing all these details to get ready. is jazz much of a if the band says they don't like rehearsing you're doing it wrong a man just like you if you're sitting on your laurels, you're wearing them on the wrong part of your body first off. Where are you rehearsing as in Miami? No, Hawaii Cleveland? Okay, let's talk cuz he even in Cleveland you can turn it into your place to your follower. What is your routine if I what music did you listen to you dig? How did you warm up simple simple things, you know most people are feared terrified of singing when they go into singing out. I don't care who it is. The first verse is always a little Titan II vs. A little better why cuz they didn't warm up. Right, right. The idea of will go in and sing along with a dozen of your favorite songs. What's your headgear on get the Reverb to sign up for me that starts with Motown? I'm a soul Growler. I'm the I'm closer to Wilson Pickett than the guy in the Rolling Stones. I don't know what that sounds like I may as well as but that's a Vibe. Yeah, that's right like that when I was 12, I started practicing that when I was 12, I started imitating The Persuasions Jerry Butler the singer. Rooster King much to decanters Chagrin in Hebrew school. Okay, again, parallel existences, you know, I'm Jewish but we've always walked around little buttons back then it said never again. I'm a combat hippie. Peace love and heavy weapons. Some people don't believe she's sometimes you got to get it's just it. Did you ever realize while you were while you were in the middle of this especially in the beginning in the early days? This was the evening. You guys had a special with Van Halen in the early days. You guys had a massive impact on culture where you guys aware of that like while it was happening how I mean when I was in high school graduate in 1985 and you guys were the shit my girlfriend might my sisters are their boyfriends. My sister's boyfriend's license Play the soundtrack soundtrack to you're okay. I get this. Absolutely. I mean, what was that. Did you was in jail when he was intentionally, I can tell you now the Van Halen's knew it but can't articulate it brighter instrumentalist. Here comes the funny joke words and my thing I understood the gas as well. Your in-game depends on how you started slick Shaz, right and we began very early on identifying that there's a whole lot of different neighborhoods in Southern California. I knew this from being with my dad all of his patients was like a Benetton ad in Okay, what you play at the birthday party in the Spanish-speaking neighborhood or Friday sometime. You got to change your evil ways Rogan. Stop is different than what we're going to play for the Surfers out of Venice Beach. That's Aerosmith stuff. Do you like that? 
========,9,title.
And then you have the Working Man Okay out of San Bernardino that ZZ Top how do judges subtle but important genius is in the details and how you interact with that crowd in between we would play out in Pomona at a biker bar guy got killed right in front of us and we finished the song what happened a couple of bike bike gangs went at it and there's a scrap and when everybody cleared out there was a fella right in the middle of the floor next night. We came back Vengeance had been sworn there are police everywhere. We pulled the amp shop from the wall. So we could hide behind the answer to pick up with the 70s was a mighty time. Wow. Alarm at 4 in the morning in the days when we carried our own equipment and stuff and things thinking of all the people who have been in there everybody should perform there and so forth in dozens and dozens of places, you know that were all a little bit different and our thing was that we could play anywhere we had two. Otherwise we had feed ourselves. Alright, and that meant 5:45 minutes that's a night five six nights if you could get it and we would ping pong all over the South lamp anywhere we could drive for two hours two hours north south or east is what how we would do in every neighborhood was a little different and that shows up in the music. You know now you can take a look at something like dance the night away or Jamie's Cryin. There's a there's a Latino influence in that. Okay. What's your favorite Cuban expecting me to name a cigar shape Ricky Ricardo. Did you ditch Rumba? Now you're thinking about you go. Yeah and kid and if you listen to dance the night away the middle break is all cha cha cha chia stuff lately because here this is she know you're surrounded by Hispanic culture here and we had heavy metal influences. Okay, we had super wealthy stop showed you have to be able to move to acoustic you got to be able to ease up if you get hired for a wedding and more importantly and perhaps an artist to artist. I don't know Springsteen better during the song or in between careful round of the Broadway show about a $12,000 ticket now and I'm guess I'm just saying before t-shirt and I'm guessing that I haven't seen the whole show. I saw some of it on Netflix of it is the in between songs songs are on all secondary, you know, if they're almost peripheral to his narration in his descriptions and his poetry when he's such a deep guy like you have to hear the in-between stuff. You want to hear imbrued. You want to hear him talk. You want to hear him think about things. Yes. And where do you learn that? Where do you learn that? Don't know if I'm going to count to thirty thousand Joe hours and hours and hours. JoJo that's not a good Springsteen. You're a good man, Joe what I was trying to get out was it does it ever freak you out? Like when you're ever alone and you think about what you guys did and what you've done in your career. Is it ever freak you out the impact you've had that if you looked at the amount of human beings have had the kind of impact that you've had its at did the tiniest tiniest fraction of a percent like the amount of human beings that can relate to your personal life experience paraphrase the James Brown movie. There's two of them. Both of them were helpful alphalete produced by Jagger. Okay, and she doesn't interview goes definitely updating me every record you here in there. Yeah. There's a little bit whenever you see videos today doesn't matter if it's hip hop doesn't matter if it's rock and roll doesn't matter if it's classic or pit. Is a LED you can trace it back you follow Christ's not. I don't think of it is impact. That's a result. What's the verb contribution? Yeah at Family reunions, whatever we go around everybody picks a word and my favorite word ever was contribution. Did you try gold climb the tree is my favorite poem. I saw it inscribed on a rock by an anonymous poet at the base. Just short of base camp on Everest go climb the Treasure Mountain do not return empty-handed. Where are you now? Oh, yeah, that's some GPS shit. What's interesting about music is different than anything else to is it brings you back to the moment where you heard it or when it was significant to you or where you don't like if I hear dance the night away if I'm in my car Dance the Night Away comes on. It's just like if you get goosebumps just have this feeling you feel like you're back in Newton, Massachusetts in high school. My favorite audience is just believing non-believers non smilers. Give me a room in North Korea and who hate everything about the trip starting with the airport get this looks like there's a why does your state hate rock and roll you give me two choruses first, we're going to drive away the evil spirits might use a little volume to do that Joe and I usually leave this here we go and drive with evil spirits and then I'm going to make you feel yesterday. How much is that worth for the lies that it's all so we have like like a big glass bowl, you know movies. Don't do that. Books will if you use the paper back in you open it up in the pages are still dried from the vacation son that are you were reading it at the beach in the Saltair made the page is kind of old and dry and crackly and some sand comes out and you get the memory music will take you right back right back right back. The women will feel desirable. You will feel invulnerable. You guys are making songs like the saying run with the devil something like that, you know when you're done. No, it's not when you're done. It's had to get that informs the whole thing. Okay, somebody asked me once. How long did it take you to write running with the devil on this is stupid question. I should well the true answer is. If you watch a thousand movies. many of the multiple times If you played thousands and thousands of hours in clubs and bars. if you've read 500 books Tried to memorize all the good parts. Take about 18 minutes. Write the song. She has Running With The Devil in 18 minutes. Yes, Jesus Christ Rhapsody In Blue, right right took 22 minutes to come up with the basic theme in the rest of its improvisation. How would you guys write how would you guys get together and do the whole point is not the 18-minute. It's the whole lifetime before it's everything that led up to that now Van Halen. We never took a demo tape around cuz we didn't get lost in the stack. We should have wear as good as we think we are still come find us and if they don't we're not forgiving instead of the requisite two-and-a-half 3 years. It takes for most asked we spent five-and-a-half years working the clubs in the bars and everything like that. So, you know wake we came in Starz and Starz. We've been we've done the state fair circus like that. I wouldn't exactly New Year's in the clubs and bars before yeah, you know Thunder Road and whatnot years of working in the red light district reeperbahn and all the club shows and stuff like that and they're adding up there getting that 10,000 and then ultimately that $30,000 Mark. Yeah the Beatles there's a I think it's Malcolm gladwell's book. We're talking about the Beatles and they're there when they came up when they're performing in Germany and they were doing these shows were there doing multiple sets at night every night of the week and that this is really what made them so good as this constant performing that they were doing it so much and so often that they just became this smoothly oiled machine. If you have a team that you're working together. Again, this is another kind of thing. I learned along the way 40 hours a week is about your minimum if there's a team like where rugby team or a SWAT team or Rob emergency room. Kind of a c block kind of intensive like that Intercity intense it we called Vietnam. Sometimes I'll 40 hours a week is Bachelor minimum that you need to train together in order to be going without looking at each other when the lights go out your you don't lose velocity. So to speak and write ultimately you'll start to look like each other. This is the nature of things The Beatles look like each other we look like each other. We all have the same haircut. We wear the same leather jackets the same as we became a golden X, you know, these are the golden years that most people look back on me for the friction of time implicate yourself to get married and have kids You bump your elbow now. I got to get my elbow work done and is in an unjust friction of time. 
========,9,title.
Which bands do you know two fractions cetera in? People routinely look back on that has the golden years you your gang. Everybody had one look back in the in graphic arts, you know, the Picasso's and the dollies and everybody wandered around in gangs the great writers in New York all hung out together and they didn't get along. You're always competing with each other. Each other. I just read in the New York Magazine some advice from the art critic Jerry saltz. Just create games and remember always treat the weakest one is your best friend because there's somebody else in the gang who thinks you're the weakest one and that's what you were going to learn from work in the clubs in the bars and stuff. Well, my strangers broke, my nose is running and I'm angry my girlfriend just ran off with two and I want to keep going I'm underpaid non respect. It's late and I'm starting to sound like double dutch bus to top it off. I'm late to work. I got bad feet and my corns hurt and you're going to play you will perform. Okay, just as you will expect that surgeon. At 4 in the morning. This is my little baby girl. That unforgiving apply that to your art Sage words. Sage words of advice you have expectations. You may not understand me. Yeah. When you guys wrote songs. How did how did you put the lyrics to the music? What was the process of how did you guys sort that out? So you would you come to them with an idea? Would they come to you with a riff like how it how it works? It'll work? A number of ways but a mistake that a lot of Young Writers in my department the lyrics Meg is that they think of it as secondary. They wait for the music or the track first and then you'll walk into a studio and hope that the hand of God will descend and grey shoe with amazing epiphanies. I can't even spell amazing. All right. And called upon to do it right away. You'll work out a bingo Dave got some lyrics if I can walk into that room and try to create it right there nine times out of 10. It's going to be moving in June. Moon in June really went sometime soon. What time of day I'm thinking noon. It's literally I'm going to put my hands in the air. Why won't cuz I just don't care. You'll wind up there unless you're banking. Think like debate if you're going to debate somebody your banking your ideas, right and whatever the subject is you can go so you don't even have to have a subject. It's okay. I like what you just said. I might even write that phrase. I like what you just said could be a Drake lyric any Expressions ideas slogans anything that comes from other Tunes in terms of their lyric and is everybody contributing not that's just me just to have volumes of that in those kinds of ideas ideas for Saint storylines Etc. You would never go into a fight without doing that collecting Rouge crime every other film of every other fighter that you possibly can so that when somebody goes like this I know what to do. Somebody says it's a song about they play a song I go out sounds kind of like cowboy music. What's right about Cowboys going through the banking? giddy up It's cool. I heard a cowboy said on the TV set and I wrote it down literally. Okay, and you start that you could I see the lights and you start banking. Okay. Somebody says something you did. I heard somebody a waitress named pepper. Where The Omelette Paul Mall cigarette? Tell me honey. Nothing could have stopped us back then anyway. That's a title that is a time. I wrote on to it. Where is this waitress? on the Rope Just too well, she also had some Elsa said she leaned her and she showed me that cleavage a little bit and she look she go keep your fork honey. There's pie. And you're right it down. Yeah banking. Yeah, I like the term they use in debate your banking banking your ideas. So when you go on the road and someone say something that you would physically write it down go home and write it down today today all the time and it goes into the box and then when it's time to deal with a given so you listen to music if the music came first in you I don't know what's just remind yourself. That sounds like country. If all your might suggest an idea to write things down physically typed them. I print print the APT in my paint and draw routinely. Okay, as you know, that's part of the martial arts sure, but when I was in Japan two and three nights a week, I call it training. I did assume you. With show me a teacher's direct sumia, it's some like calligraphy pen and ink in in the world of the digital future. I spent two years practicing for Shades of Grey into Shades of Black. You want to see my Wesson. Can you do can you focus a camera if I stand up? Can you forget what you was my last? Okay, I'm going to walk from here to here. Okay, I'm here painting. Okay. I'm the only guy in there. Okay. No. okay, after 6 months, I heard better Jesus Christ after almost 10 months I shut down because Mr. Roth, I think you are my best student. I should not my painting. You should not have now your banking. You are most determined you are most sincere. You really enjoy most like this, please. Thank you. Sorry, should I wish to invite you to directors meeting?

Alfred I like that in this day and age it must be insanely difficult to get someone to have that sort of appreciation for commitment. Well, it's it's a national thing you learn that stuff in grade school and it started like music lessons painting and calligraphy is as well known as prep piano lessons and what were you thinking while you were doing all this while you learn this and spending months and months? I focus on specifically that knowing that at the end of the term. I'm going to be a little and I'm sharpening things a little bit and when I'm called upon even to have the discussion like this. Yeah, I can bring a little contribution to it. It can be more entertaining for all of you listening to this. It can an amazing recognition that you have though that you realized while you were doing this that even though consciously all you're doing is doing calligraphy. You're working on other parts of your mind. I knew I was never going to pay for shit 50 Shades of Dave, but you were still focusing 100% of your energy on doing it while you're doing it under something to that counts. It's the preparation.

You have to be creative on levels everything from Adobe Photoshop to social engineering and platforming dealing with marketing publishing all the way that publishing is changing magazines now, I'll make U digital. Are you approaching the same with your approach calligraphy told you that? Hertz Centric singing and dancing paid every penny for the company and this is what I bring to it mostly when you have a celeb get involved in something like that. J.Lo does fashion. She's not really taking a pen and ink a drawing out the words and drying out the clothes somebody passes things in front of her and she makes sounds I'm assuming it goes like this. I'm a guy who has to interpret those sounds yeah and and and in cuz it's got to be sense of humor makes the name of my company is laugh to win and it doesn't have anything to do with Mirth. Call the best Pirates laugh, especially if it's the last one roof on the freeway, and I'm sure the when you were when you were actually it's kind to me. Just how much you time how much you time is involved in this significant amount of time or back and forth. And do you like a real professional now like a professional corporate dude, you look into at the 50 hour work week saying and no no, no. It's art-centric, right? it starts with What was the need what was involving me. Just like when Alex Honnold goats climbing he's going to put on some sunblock and he doesn't want to touch that shift for another 4 hours, right? So I built it for can I cracked my two molars and walked around for three years with no molars on this side of my head when I quad Dengue Fever. Okay, cuz the sunblock in the stuff that had the mosquito shit in it washed off when I got out of the ocean, so I solved it. And we are stripper friendly, but we are not strippers so I don't like Shane. Okay, so it's okay. I don't want to shame there's room for Friday nights. It took three years and more than you want a quote to solve that is every time you going you smell something you crack the jar of anything. Somebody has played with that probably in New Jersey think like this. I'm already doing the pitch you like ice cream on your kids do gelato even better. Okay suppose you want to make coconut vanilla?

We'd be kayaking and somebody keep dropping the yours cuz something was slippery and you follow so okay. Someday. I'm going to solve this someday. I'm going to solve this when you're in your twenties. There's an aha moment when you're my age, there's more than one and that's when we went to high again third time today and we can to expand laugh to win makes pink the original and we have 60 other products coming up all of it developed for people who live in Vans like Alex Honnold folks who live in transit at hotels people who live urban camping is what we do, especially me and my tour bus everything I do is in the Disco submarine.

I got to stabilize got fit in my backpack. Every container has to be able to be sat on in a third world airport. You got to be able to Stevie Wonder it in your backpack. It's an insensitive illusion analogy. But every one of our containers is such that you can stick your hand in the bag while you're driving and find it. I'm safety-conscious. What are the kids in the car? So this is done by Design the shape of the package is done by the national. Absolutely. What is it look like chump pulled up Jamie.

Set a reminder is going to think was that shit all over Bobbies armed like this and it's going to get all over your T-shirt. Right? And your wife has a $600 t-shirt doesn't she Joe? Okay, you got to consider all of this? Okay. I saw a nice car out there. I'm guessing there's nice upholstery in it. I took that into consideration. I got you covered.

Okay, the limit of what's going into the oceans now in the tourist areas and World in Hawaii, you can count on one hand the products. They're allowing to be used on the beaches in even in the swimming pools that comes out of percent organic stuff. It's all waxes and butters up when people talk about Miracle ingredients. I think in terms of There's water and then there's Fiji. butter eggs sugar flour That's all that there is in the bakery. All right, we invented the cronut. Guy took the best of this and the best of that and the considerations again come from life experience. I didn't just look at myself and go. Wow. Here's an idea to make money. My fortune has been made. What we did is find what we can use when we're living out of backpacks what we can use when we go dancing. I still go dancing and I don't leave that floor for 4 hours. Where to go dancing? I'm not telling you go. Oh, yeah routine, right if I work today. I know New York City, for example, mr. Chen lives right next to mr. Gomez, they both live over Mr. Katzenberg. Mr. Radical vich owns the building of them can speak to each other. They all speak a different language. They're all different religions. So there's two ways. We communicate versus swearing. You know how to do that one seven eight words and swearing you can describe anyting the shows the shit show you the shit. Thank you. What kind of shity you doing like that last fight that was a shed in the next ink. She got a chicken on one arm and a clip of her and the girl. There's got cupcakes with funny noses. Let me guess. He's got musical note. Can I guess more and and and And it has Ferrari walk out in front of Columbia University at lunch time. It's the future you would not know that it's United States. It is a complete composite International just the smell of all the food trucks. The last thing you smell is salami and and yellow cheese on white bread. Thank God say thank God in a few other languages, but really it's a communication and that's part of my fascination with it constantly evolving Esperanto art form. I visited tribes in New Guinea who can't dance they don't have they don't dance but did have tattoo it. They did have scars Iceman. They found of the glacier that died in the other found his body. I forget what they call a guy with his name is but he had tattoos on them thousands of years old. Captain start a G+ Hangouts wrestling good and easy listening.

We always make fun but there's one of them in your past that guy. Banks on his hair. I mean if that guy went bald like me, he'd be fucked. It still is the exact same fabulous, right? Yeah amazing genetics. They got a lucky break one of the characters who are other characters like that David Hasselhoff sure now has hassle book. What is that on Facebook thing for a ship Jesus Christ a hassle. Who's fucking cold? Have you? Passiflora comolli shit who was Anna Nicole Smith? And then there's married to the old dude, little does. She like the last one to the rich right before she dies, but there are folks also that don't have faces Springsteen never had a face was always Springsteen there. That is looking good Fabio is about 85 years old. Still Jack. Is that right? I don't say I'm working out a lot. But he's there was he do if he's at the gym. I don't know talking to women and Dam still scoring, but you don't but you do but you don't ya you want to take about the guy that wants a bank Fabio. Super pumped about it. He's coming over in 5 minutes. I got to get ready. What are you watching on TV? Trump television guess what? Are you watching? Regularly? Cuz I don't have television I listen to SiriusXM routinely while listen to like six different channels over and over again lately. I'm watching The Marvelous mrs. Maisel which is a net it say not Netflix gives me it's an Amazon show. It's an Amazon original show about a stand-up comedian the 1950s women stand up comedian who hangs out with Lenny Bruce. It's really good joke a really good show women stand up comedians and there's a great subject Sarah Silverman hurdle, cuz one of the things that she does best is play the part of the character. She's lampooning. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. She plays the part beautifully a witless races to whatever and her hurdle is that a large segment of the audience doesn't realize that it's an act. Well now now does the hurdle especially now if you go back and look at some of her older bits and look at any special you looked at it written down as opposed to her saying it we're in such an overwhelmingly sensitive time when it comes to subject matter that yeah, that would be a big hurdle for now, but it's the best work ever and then they such an impact. The first time I ever saw her do it in. This is a tradition that goes all the way back to Lincoln. There was a fellow who wrote that has be letters where he pretended to be a southern racist and making fun of Southern racism by Hillary tending to be Lincoln kept the Articles clip from the newspaper in his drawer so we can read them occasionally and laugh during the Civil Wars. This is a tradition of acting out the character that you are about to execute. Unfortunately.

There's a lot what what is the chemistry that folks don't understand that you are pretending they don't care. It's not it's a dishonest approach. They don't care. Tonight you're pretending what day did they see you have said something or there's something written that shows that you said something that they feel is in violation. And so they want to go after it and it it doesn't make any sense. Yes, it's literal and it's also it's disingenuous because they know it could be parody and they don't care. There's so much of that today. It's really interesting. It's really interesting because there's so many people that are they just looking for things to be upset about the recreational outrage and I think it's probably because things are going so well in this world, I mean side, I mean some people say it's not going that well, you know, there's a lot of things to be fixed for sure this time to be alive ever. It just is is undeniably the safest time to be alive. I think people are more open-minded than ever more kind than ever is less violence Endeavor all the you look at pinker's work. All these things are trending in a very very clear and obvious Direction and I think when you have coddled minds and you have More safety people start running around looking for things to be upset at and also a lot of young people that are very idealistic think they're going to change the world and one of the ways are going to change the world by policing language to policing when people talk about things and discuss things and so stand up comedy, which is you know, you say a lot of things you don't really mean cuz they're funny, you know, that's the whole point behind it. And so it's ripe is too it's far as a target for that kind of recreational outrage. The musical equivalent. Perhaps is really shity songs written about important subjects and remind you of overdue dentist appointment. Sounds like water hot water being thrown to the cat but it's about starving. Children. Don't go there to you. But we all know the song the song even if it's just music. That sounds like we shall overcome sure. I love Pats beautiful. You just really important subjects that are terrible movies. Like how many caused me to think that if it's are really really important subject it probably is a terrible Move Ya most like why do I think that right? Well, there's no way to really get an important subject and boil it down to 2 hours. All I can think of that, you know temperature hours. One thing that drives me crazy is when they take liberties with someone's biography like if they would do a biography on someone's life and they change things around or add things to it for the actual Flair. Did you see the queen movie? I haven't seen it either very good though. You heard? It's very good. Yes, that's the person who told you that why it's good. Yes. Yes. They said the first of all the guy who plays Freddie Mercury apparently brilliant in it. And it said they had they seen Freddy live. No not live at The Forum. I was in the maybe 20th row 6 in when Bohemian Rhapsody had just come out all my goodness. Yeah. I saw him. It is absolutely true that his major major Prime there. So I'm very curious as to will stagecraft is one thing but what Freddy was and what he brought was way more than what you Yeah, yeah, what was he bringing? Well, his sensibilities in terms of Music weren't just three chords in an attitude and don't fall for that shit either Keith ever sits here and tries to 833 Coles in an attitude and you need to know the inversions of each one all seven modal knit. Fuck you guys know all those and the trick doings and whatever ya Freddy brought a whole wealth of listening to different kinds of music whether it was orchestral big band Bistro, you mean that's what you call a small something. You might hear in a coffee shop in French what his music was so different. His singing was so different than anything else from his era. We listen to We Are The Champions He didn't try to sing black. Okay sing Freddie Mercury when he sang European non-black. What were very used to even in country. I had a very famous black producer African American producer say to me David Lee. Did you know what it means to be a black man United States should ask every time I step up to the mic. I try are you guys when I grew up with trying to sound like, you know that Boardwalk had such an impact on music much less the overall culture and comedy is well. I mean if I had a vote for the greatest all-time comedian would be prior the greatest of all time low. I would have to say it's he's in the running. I mean it if it's not him. I don't know who it is. Audrey with yeah, I always so many some I mean it will you look at African American stand-up comedians in the contribution in terms of like the overall numbers are the top 10 a giant chunk of them would block a giant shark Chappelle Chris Rock, but it definitely prior because I got to forget about Bernie Mac Bernie. Mac is goddamn genius, you know, a lot of people don't know about Robin Harris. Robin Harris is a huge influence to people in the 90s ladies in the 90s when he died. He died thinking of early 90s your Illuminating for the audience, but here you're preaching to the already judged it once I think it's because of the I grew up with comedy record. Yeah Redd Foxx and if you can still hear doing on the classic comedy channel on Sirius XM and his shit is still funny still good. Is everything imitating Redd Foxx? Yeah Usher and you know, I mean Bill Cosby Cosby was obviously a horrible person in retrospect but his art form is artwork was amazing, I mean I wasn't ready records you memorized word for word you memorize Richard Pryor your memorize Redd Foxx you memorize Bill Cosby and you memorize Rodney Dangerfield, oh yeah, okay that's those are the four horsemen if we run out of conversation at a beer soaked frat party High School whatever which is in about two sentences you see you either quote your favorite movies that's how you would Converse is guys yeah. Yeah, I need a doctor told me I have to run to even try this with the staff she gave it how you doing She got my doctor told me I had to run a mile a day and then call him 10 days later. And well, I'm calling you. I'm 10 miles away Rodney Dangerfield. You learn comedy records and you sat around the record player and learned. I don't think people do that. It didn't know that was a thing man. 
========,9,title.
When I was curious listen to Cheech and Chong Big Bambu with all sit around and listen to the record. Yeah, man, and that was a different one too because they weren't even doing stand-up there. That was a completely unique thing. You're doing sketch comedy on record. It's interesting that pot culture which is international now. Okay started with an alien and a Hispanic. Yeah, they were the kings of it aged. You can again sideburns many decades later. How many decades are in a rock climbing as far away is humanly possible from anything ever made by God man, or others place called r r a police.About 4 hours north of Melbourne out in the middle of nowhere big sand drip castles. You can dial it up fyrewrap Elite and we had a couple of campers like trucks that we part we put up a tarp in the middle and campfire and whatever.And a Little Love a Little television screen and we plug that into the car battery. Okay, and I went to the other campsites cuz we fucked job not broad enough, whatever. It was water food or whatever. That's a wrap, please and I went to the different campsites and invited everybody. You know, how a man can I borrow a little while or anything like this next year? We're going to be watching Cheech and Chong over under the far Edge over there. You'll see us you'll be like come on over and join us.From all over the world. You got guys from Thailand you got girls from England. It was the great leveler sleeping bags laughing in 7 languages amazing and now to get those guys in here. Dogs are talking to each other. So make sure you never know. Who are they actually talking to each other tracks has that has this gone Eddie and Dave day for a while. It does have an idiot day for a while, but they're back. Yeah, they're back together. They were touring quite a bunch of success brought them back together going to realize like everybody wants to see Cheech and Chong. Everybody doesn't really want to see Chong or Cheech. You know what? I mean? Not that everybody doesn't want to see them but the numbers are so different the numbers of people that I meet Tommy Chong it's very well love a guy but the together they're they're exponentially more powerful the Everly Brothers. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, it should but the culture changed a man of his times sometimes the times changes and yes the times now represent that which day in a free doing something that was illegal. This is illegal comedy. There's a legal subject matter today in Studio City. You can spend a 10-day Vacation if you came from somewhere and just worked from the sushi bar to The Dispensary on Studio C. There's a space is about 2 mi long. You can spend 10 days come visit us from Japan stay at the Marriott all the way in here or whatever. It is universal and you can eat sushi on just work from sushi bar to dispensary for sushi bar to dispensary there to look at that up on the screen. There's a whole schedule. Where are they working? I can't read it says there in Richmond BC the River Rock Casino in Vancouver at the Hard Rock South Lake Tahoe is a bunch of places San Juan Puerto Rico in the house switchlinc average age of comics today. The best ones are in their forties and fifties it seems like right now. Really? Yeah between Chris Rock Dave Chappelle while you're right. OKC gay Bill Burr. Yeah are the best of Joey Diaz. All the best guys are in the 50s. Like I don't know. There's a lot of gangster movies on Netflix, right? Yeah, and when it's that in the fellas are older they're wearing tuxedos and now they're in night clubs. Like Ciro's kind of 21 club and then that change to Comedy Cellar and you know, something like that today. It's also about productivity like you you have to be able to put out baterial in you because most of us are doing Netflix specials now and most of us seem to be on a schedule of doing one every couple of years. So you have to be able to turn over an hour every couple years and then take that our & Hammer that motherfucker down to a samurai sword scuse me a katana blade hammerdown polish that played you have to have it. And then you have to know when to release it, which is one of the things that I asked how do you know when you're running a song like running with the devil? How do you know when it's done? Cuz with a bit be kind of don't know because you do it differently all the time you fuck around with it on stage. And you know, I'm at how long does it take to do an hour? It just fascinated changes it changes is no real one thing. I would sometimes I come up with a new hour and like like 4-5 months and sometimes it take me a whole year. It's it's just really it's really different every time depending on how much effort I put into it and also depending upon how lucky I get with subjects like sometimes there's a subject is just Rich almost like at you hit a gold mine and like you that you saw that you hit that money. Like there's so much here and there so many also branching off little rivers from this. Mine is One initial mine. So there's there's that you never know. You never know. It's it's it's hard to tell Fascinating I want to mess around with it. It moves and changes. I do it differently all the time. You know, I'm a I'm a Giants fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd and one of things I always thought was crazy about Skynyrd was their reps when they would do guitar riffs. It was the same riff. They when they when they would do a solo their solos were like orchestrated like they don't get enough credit for bring Dynamic musical artist as well as these Southern dudes that were just drinking singing about whiskey and getting away from women like they're fat ugly dude in most other songs about getting away from women. Like I got to go I got to be free. I'm moving on Call Me The Breeze it was something I can get the fuck out of here for you lock me down. There was a big part of the music, but when you see like a like sum of their like Freebird that free bird solo that can start which is one of the greatest solos in the history of all music for this one of the more specific reason is you had to build it has a beginning a middle a crescendo and end their specific names today. When we move to more channels in recording window energy had a record it all their early stuff as 8-track and then you had to double up a relief and healing same thing. You had to compile your tracks. Whatever time you had to really walk in with your solo written OK and play and you would work it until it really had a thing on once there were many tracks guys would come in and just Wing It Go. Okay. Let's try one. Let's do it again and they just make it up as they go. Okay, and then when it's time to Max, they'll put a little attraction oil attract sex and start moving those channels in a way that you would never think to play the guitar. For example Ed started doing that on a couple of tracks, right? Original solos Running With the Devil did it it it it it it it it is. Okay. These are somatic saw Lowe's Most Beatles solos dematic your father son of the song. I ain't talking about like this you'd record six different versions of the solos. Okay, and then just started move the channel to learn the soul. Oh wow. So you'll see his hand move from down here to up here and down there. It became a gymnastic effort more elbow and shoulder to get his hand from the far end of the fretboard all the way up to the pickup and back to duplicate. Dad's wabisabi approach to making solos. So it was a very a week or unique kind of way of creating a solo was utilizing the digital digital future multi-tracking and improvising as opposed to I'm going to sit down and I'm going to just I'm going to create something like a book. Here's the beginning. Here's the senior the characters. Here's the conflict instead. It's let's just makes that all up together and interesting ways in literary Burrows came up with Bill Burrows many many years ago came up with the idea of writing a book than clipping the pages into pieces putting them all in a hat and pull the pieces out one-by-one this piece number one. This is peace number to Pace number three, and that's the way you actually remember a story. I don't get that you remember a wedding? Yes, you don't remember in sequence or I wear the patch party. Then I got measured for the text you then I want to hear you. Remember bash party did putting the ring. Then I was throwing up back behind the sequential order. Right? So it's another way of kind of a crafty way of writing an essay perhaps bit difficult to digest what movies are made that way now in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. Why is the Statue of God he's running across the top of a drink cuz they started in as opposed to here's the field horse walks onto the field. I don't see the cabin but I'm getting from this one in regards to the song making a particular the way Eddie and you did it was there's no shortcuts, you know, the fact that. First of all, he know he's one of the great Masters right Eddie Van Halen's when the Great Masters if you have a hundred of the greatest guitar artists of all time in the history of the human race season that certainly made a contribution come in sure what that hundred percent. 
========,9,title.
So you have to have that Pretend There's also no shortcuts. Even when you're a great Master though. There's no shortcut. You will have to sharpen and sharpen and show you describe sharpening a sword. I visited Foundry where they make swords north of Tokyo. I was at his work goes in the Museum's that is one of the things that I really want to do the other guys with hammers super sweaty hot like they like this in the 1600. That's not who sharpens and polishes the story. That's my other friend who's 55 years old lives in a suburb of joking. That's all he does for a living. So they take the first sword to him and then he sharpens at yes. He's the one who makes it get that chrome finish. So the man who forges it does not sharpen the correct skin specialty is that always been shored pot. Sword Paula shirt does the sharpening and that's a specialty requires shirt and stones from different parts of Japan. You don't use Wheels you use the old stones from the mountain chatra use water from a wooden bucket. You rub it with your hands just 55 years old. This is all he does for a living museums from around the world. Is there video this Oh, yeah, what's the gentleman's name? We'll find it. I'm stalling for sec. He wasn't very little apartment and he's got two gun safes. Like you would use, you know, like Liberty Gun Safes. Yeah and museums from all over the world and shorts. Are you? Okay, that's become Rusty humidity 3. I was that. Okay. This is that pants at spaced and he's going to be using that's what they used to laminate by putting paste on that sword parts of it will cool differently. Anyways, so that sharpening a sword takes forever. That's what makes your patterns. It's a little different of hard disk than you want the rest of the sort you clad it. When is that stuff is pasting on it. What was that stuff? It's made of Ash and it's made of. Or ore wow. And so when it heats up is that when it becomes a part of the sword why he's going to laminate that okay. This is wild. Scientists save this motherfucker with his lab coat is examining. You going to ruin it get him out of there at that scientists padding like that. That's Ash. So he's putting little pieces of Ash on and on furnaces Stone on a sword which is why they cost so much why are many different kinds of stones that they'll use a different parts of the sword? Can you dig the point that the top gets a different kind of stone in the middle of the sword cetera? It's amazing like the Japanese culture and especially when when you look into the ancient Samurai culture, like a book of five rings one of my greatest all-time books. I thought I'd live read it by dozens of times my life, but just sit to put yourself in the mindset of someone with such a singular Vision too, too. Great to become a great Samurai.

Karate this so many different styles that were perfected in This One Small Place Oak Aged and island with you and that lends itself towards grilling down burrowing really digging in. Yeah. We follow somebody is going to make a sword. It takes 6 to 4 people to make one sword. The person who makes the handle is not the person who raps to handle the person who makes the sword is not the one who sharpens it. The caller the furniture on the sword the pack that holds it in that Gold's collar. That's a different person and the person who makes the Scabbard for the short is a different person want to keep going.

They are there spiritual and some Strange way they're at peace in some strange way. And I think part of it is because they're constantly on that ocean and I think the ocean is like a battery. I think you get energy out of it. I think it fits a lot of it feels alive. I think it's stimulates you in a very unique way and with those guys they're riding these immense waves these these creations of Nature and gravity in force and mass and water and they're white riding them and they're writing a living thing is organisms in it.

Do you notice a difference with people paying attention? Text moves. Yeah, I know that getting off the line could take a week. Dwight changes in counting on how long it takes is everybody's got to sign off their phone to turn off the computer do as or whatever by and large. What I have noticed is that when people are watching you they no longer can have their hands in their pockets and pretend to be Wesley you pretend to stare into your cell phone. That's true. Best 1960s now they listen to tend to in a place. I walk into a cargo carriers cell phone. I walk into a coffee shop or a restaurant or keep it a club which is essentially a social experience and everybody is blind staring into their cell phones with different bank hats and different whenever I'm more often than not I'm the only one who's actually present looking seeing have you ever even smelled with those things? Have you ever sure fuck with them? And you decide it's not for you. I'm going to let you in on a little secret very digitally literate. I can fly six-million-dollar helicopter backwards. Can you really yes. But it forces people to make eye contact you want to talk to me. You should just like this and you can't text me cuz that's avoidance. Yeah, there's a whole lot of offer amps.

Yes, and it became a constant as show people we are targets targets for love targets for greed targets for proximity Etc and became constant Interruption became a constant sheet in an effort to find my way to where Shane Dorian is.

Anyway, I don't want this anymore to constant of I called you. How come you didn't call me back right away and also indicates, you know as you start to call over and over and over again, it's like a treasure your follow your stalkers. Sure got a good one. I got a Stocker make prank call. I can tell you what time get to work. I can tell you what time he goes home. I can tell you if you went to church and then brunch and what time you got home from that I can tell you if you had something to drink the night before and went home and slept it off the next day. It's the nature of communications Ryan for Tracer bullets work both ways boy indicate everywhere you are and everything you do on your entire thing of your life, very orwellian, especially with social media right now and probably the last thing I want you to know about me. Good morning. I am not kidding nothing of giving into this non-human device and an integrating it with your life you and where people just didn't ever leave it alone. They're constantly on at the checking it with then you're not even getting anything out of it. You're just checking it for nothing. You just checking your email checking your photos checking. Your Instagram is nothing coming. Nothing positive coming out of its just took this weird distraction from Life used to use the frigerator for that. Yeah. That's right. It's almost the same you're so right. It's like a digital version of opening the refrigerator when you know, nothing's in there you crazy. That's so true. So true. It's like a boredom exercise. Yeah. It's a habit. You just got to reach for it. Do you have one just in case you have to use it or I'm giving away all my secrets bile constantly. In the grit, okay. I'm at one of my closest colleagues that I work with two or three nights a week. Colin Smith is read 17 books on how to run Adobe Photoshop. We've been working on an art project together for quite some time will debut that at another time. I love the energy. I love what the digit future has brought to us. My only real regret in life is that I didn't have this grown up. I'll look it up. I should have that tattooed. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great time for finding things out the information if you want to learn the Encyclopedia Britannica was what we had, was nonsense and Canterbury records in case you wanted some music which was an hour's bike ride. Okay, I can keep going and now you can get music like me when I was flavor of the week. The first time I did all the Rockstar stuck in one of the first things that I wanted to do cuz I read that Elton John did that you would get him to close the store Storage Shop Around by yourselves and don't know you have a security guy of course brings a pillowcase. What's your records? It takes you don't even read the liners. If you have a good cover here in the cat. What they do is sit alone something that I used to buy records based on how cool the cover looked a chance routinely, I would routinely I would shop by weight. Okay, I would do that at bookstores to as much as we could carry coming out of the book stores. For example, I like many different kinds of music. One of my favorites is danceable Electronica R&B. Disco anything that hasn't call it floor. If it has anything to do with dancing, it's 4 and you were no floor stations here in the in California in the 70s. You wanted to hear anything. That's you know, you had KJLH maybe if you know some small am kind of a station, but you went to New York you had let me put that phone so I can do the voice. This is Paco wktu Shadow traffic DJ's if something is missing from our culture the cabinet by the time I side with the best bed for the boss be the top of the pops Mash gold on Diamond Dave. No time to waste making the taste baby. Shut up time to play the record baby chokes man, Jack. Those guys are gone that that's like a missing segment of our culture. I was in Pasadena you listening for the first FM radio underground station, which was kppc. It was metromedia. I believe was Channel 5 tell me if this gets too boring. Here's the history of it is during the Cold War right around 1965-66. It became illegal imperative that all radio stations regular ones had to operate an FM band station FM has been around since the 1930s my uncle Manny remembered it, but it never got used it was AM radio. KFWB channel 98 why because you in case there's a National Emergency you are not allowed to take your normal programming go from kowb and put it on your sister station on FM had to be different programming. Okay, you can't just dominate FM because you got the advertisers your Channel 5 get a lot advertises. You got to roll Scheib car painter. So you've got Chase and Sanborn coffee. You're going to squeeze me, which is 106.7 today's K-Rock or whatever you'd like 106 right in there and they brought in it literally all these FM stations channel do the bosses. You know, all said, well my nephew he's he loves that rock stuff. You know, he's got a lot of Records. Maybe you'll be a DJ kind of thing or who could be a DJ for this. If I don't know who's Anon screamer the Jazz guys, they brought in Big Daddy Tom Donahue and his wife Rachel and they came in and start broadcasting on kppc and Thomas Jazz DJ and he would talk just kind of like this and he does. Okay, we got to Do Quicksilver here? Can't wait till it comes out stereo. Take a listen now. first side see you in a few. Yeah, and we would practice that there's an art to that is an art of preparing you for a new song Brandy wouldn't yeah, he's developed a hand like DJs you don't like jazz guys back then a lot of homework. doing things that Cuz you to slow down. It on me and we started doing those things, too. We get Lord Lord, KJV. the strength of patience Joe knows what I do right after it would set you up for the music. You don't really enjoy the music a little bit more because of that guy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I would get into Hanston Conoco conspiring streaming services were smart. They would bring that shitback did find someone, you know, because like streaming services of the new radio right me that's where a lot of people get their music great. Are you talking about like Pandora and a spot of things to say to Apples pitch was they have a whole radio section on Apple music may have chosen. What is it in the natural? Okay, great movie probably has to fall Duvall's a writer writer and make it into a little bit of an argument. Somebody says you don't play baseball. He says, yeah, but have a good day. I can make it look a little bit more interesting. A little more exciting. Yeah, you see what you help you understand what you have paraphrase or that's what I do with the color commentary for his exact implicate everything drama pesos hilarity call in one paragraph. Yeah. I've watched you go to channel seamlessly. I grew up with the Great's Scully Cosell sound tell me some tell me how he so cash is placing Salt Lake cash, but You have DJs they're not really GJ's they are representatives of a lifestyle for eczema. I'm going into DJ voice cuz I got the headphones become too aware. So goes down and have been to sleep since the late eighties. What was I talking about? I started ripping their now when you listen, for example of Sirius XM you have for example of the country artist. Sure. Okay, it is no shoes radio and she and get some he's not a humorist. Okay, he's not even an interlocutor where you in the NBA hold and so it came to pass like in Greek tragedy and weekend. So it came to pass that the sun came in the war was won in this not that it's Kenny Chesney going and I say it with respect, you know that skinny, and I was just walking down here in Panama City and my phone went dead and I walked in and I asked Goodfellas right here. The Joe Rogan barbecues are fired up if I could just sort of charge it up and they said hell, yeah, so I just want to tell you I'll come down Road. No, it's fine. It's right here on no shoes radio something. Set the same. He's kind of being Tom Petty. You was a co-conspirator. Are you don't like it? Hey, man, I'm down here in the basement man. I'm listen to some rexmont down Wilbert's firebomb. Can you please check this out? This is fucking tasty dishes to Newport choose the music to that was the other thing about TJC they would choose the music. I don't know. What tastemakers. Yeah that makes a big difference. I did not think about was listen to wbcn in Boston. It was like 1980s and they wanted to play Michael Jackson and the guy said listen, I know this isn't rock is WBC and was a rock Boz to sure they like looking know this is a rock. But damn this is good music and they played Billie Jean. I'm overthinking why what a bold choice. What's a bold choice in a certain sense? 
========,9,title.
Okay, and the certain sense is that after a while FM radio became very codified, you know, just like the horse races somewhere in the mid-70s late seventies and became a playlist in the end no longer pick their own records program directors picked the records, okay? It became very specific Target demo. We want to home and and whatever I keep in mind when Howard Stern left regular radio terrestrial radio for the stratosphere. I got a job in New York City Hall. That's right. I was broadcasting in 7 different cities. I forgot you did that Dallas new Phila. I think I was young and shut your cetera and it turns out I think what they wanted was a version of Howard Stern the third class Howard Stern her first class David Lake my approach to is very different than his would-be were two very different people riding. He's talked to use a personality. It's all about interaction. I see myself as show people. I'm music first. Okay. So the first thing I'm going to pick when we throw a barbecue is not the food or the guest list, but what's the music? Well white people listen to Bob Marley when we're on vacation and when we celebrate thing we listen to call in the things were going up and they were pissing off management really. Well, they should we feel that Lynyrd Skynyrd and Nickelback or more appropriate for your audience. So their ratings are going up and never upset and because you couldn't rain me in. Okay. Keep in mind. I hired Kool & the Gang open for Van Halen tour before last you have never seen so many people dancing in one place that starts the sound of every wedding Bar Mitzvah from bachelor party in the field and got to save each other as you're driving. What was the conversation when you agreed to do it? What did you think was going to happen as opposed to what did happen? Well what you say and what is real? Yeah, that's the problem right now is doing commercials for example, and I don't feel comfortable doing commercials unless it's something I actually use around like sunglasses or cigarettes. Vermont Care Bear kind of a thing. I don't know right so it was uncomfortable from the beginning. I got fired for playing too much ethnic music and for late-night humor too early in the morning, but that was Howard Stern's whole deal was late night humor. No, it's not different kind of here is well whenever we brought on pornstars, I actually knew him kind of expect you to do all talk or do they want you to play music as well as the patient's in our end of the business and broadcasting. Okay, but There's no snare drum hi-hat nor is there for our you follow he's with the music I start with the ambience and of humor arises or personalities are rise, or we have guests rate if we don't that's fine, too. And I think they expected other. What I showed up with was it it also arranged it wasn't always funny was just maybe something you would have excelled at if they'd had different expectations like the following Howard Stern to just do that David Lee Roth show spectations was the funny the funny interview. The gas have pop culture funny guests are in the subject matter just as we've touched on subjects here that are hilarious and so is your pretty dense as I call it. You just going to detonate halfway down the turnpike. Oh, that's what he fucking meant. Just going to go away real quick to you or one of these streaming services came to you and wanted to do something like that to always arrive with expectations. And the expectations are just as we discussed the three phases of Anna Nicole Smith and Elvis. Which Dave are you referring to just with someone like you? I mean, I'm not a program director. But if I was I would say just let him be him. Just figure it out. Just let it give it time to grow. That's what people don't do. They metal that they are like you're going to do I look from what I know of you you're going to do your best at everything everything you do. You're going to do your best if I was going to hire you that's what I would say everybody get the fuck away from him. He's going to do his best. Now let him hire who he wants to hire and do what he wants to do and probably wants to put on Let Him figure it out. But you hire David Lee Roth didn't hire Mike Fitzgerald Inn ending in Ken Buchanan where the fuck the other people are that work in the office and also want the jizz in the soup know you hire David Lee Roth let David Lee Roth P David Lee Roth and let him find his legs. That's difficult entity because comes with a lot of history. Yeah, you know, then the people will start folks will start conducting energy has a very specific expect ya usually there's a lot of a lot of freedoms. There's a lot of you know, what you discussing it's something that I think about occasional so it seems like something you'd be open to a job just from this particular interview. I would be very open to it. You know, they've approached me before you talk about it might interest in music is diverse, but it's energized switch to of course, you know, he does his own radio show and he picks his own playlists like one of the last few things that a person like him. He's able to do like that and he doesn't want to eat once a week right Vision one night a week does and he loves it when you something else to reproach me for is writing a column some of the good magazines have approached me big ones about becoming a writer choosing to you bet you bet. It's a it's a different sound when I write. Yeah. It's Is in a bit of a different voice, it's my sense of humor comes out a little bit more in terms of Darkness. I remember reading an article in New York Magazine's for bags 1968. I don't remember the element the fellow was the theater critic for New York Magazine and the title was in defense of booing interesting. Would you have to tolerate clapping especially for shity performances, right? There's The Clapper who claps because they're part of the gang and there's The Clapper yells Bravo so that they exist I am heard. Any jokes about how your week gets thrown out of an opera for buoying and everybody New Year's in Italy they permit bullying and I support that sneaks in not just as a as a form of negative targeting. Okay, but as a form of elevating to go to the golf swing guy put on all the electrodes they do the slow-motion things are in your gray Joe now he wants to go see your wrist. Yeah. There's no booing. A lot of folks are going to go and she's just me and you your concentrate on the negative. I love Brewing as much as going yet. In fact I can think of certain heavy metal records that we could discuss on the airplane from LA to New York. That's 5-hour flight and I could discuss the record endlessly as long as we're going boo. We're discussing what's wrong with it. You can go for 5 hours. What's great about it. How long you going to stay in that 20 minutes is really smart. and smart Criticism identifying the Flies not negative. It's just reality kids monster movies. Is she the string? You see the smoke you see the Flying Saucer? It looks fake. That's emerging. You feel smugly Superior you always look at that thing that she is a form of bullying now today for people weren't doing that. You wouldn't have black panther. You wouldn't have Spider-Man you wouldn't have Avengers and all the amazing special effects and CGI and everything because of high expectations and I'll get back to you by David Lee Roth just had three hours. He believed that Time flies when you don't know what you do what you know, you know what you're doing you slice son of a bitch doing nothing means on my way to doing what website is the original the original should we make it for everybody who's got ink anybody was got tattoos and stuff at virtually everything that you're going to use in the Boudoir the bathroom and if you could put in a locker, but especially that bright your man. That's just the shit dad that will read bone no more rubbing it with your finger and cetera and we got a whole product line come in laugh to win today going to order a bunch of shit. So there's the door will have it delivered. I love you. God bless David Lee Roth your bad motherfuker. Call me free in there. That's a very special belt to wear. Thank you, sir. David Lee Roth ladies and gentlemen, good night.
