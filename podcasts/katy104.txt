Well it's a pleasure to be here with you, Katy. I, as many of my listeners and you probably know now too, I speak about movement and all the ways movement fits in the world. And a lot of times my perspective is kind of ancestral health practices and even though we are all living, one of the situations of living is that we are often involved in the deaths of others. And so I look at things like what are the sedentary influences on various things. After losing 3 people last year within a few weeks of each other, it really kind of moved death to the forefront of my thoughts about movement and thus this show. And so I found some of your work online. So I wanted to talk to you about what you do. So you lead workshops that teach people how to care for and prepare bodies for funerals and I want to talk a little bit about that as well as what kinds of movement are included or involved in that type of work. Sure. Well, let me give you a little background about myself. I'm 67 years old and I was a funeral director in Los Angeles between the tender ages of 24 to 38. And I gained a lot of experience and insights in doing that work. I left it after 14 years and then returned in a different way to the topic as a home funeral educator. Ok, so my first question for you is, what is a green burial council? The green burial council is a not for profit group. I believe it's located nowadays in Ojai, California. The Green Burial Council has set down international standards for green burial in private cemeteries, municipal cemeteries so that the public is assured that they are receiving a green burial where the remains go back to the earth in as pure a way and uninterrupted way as possible. So it basically has set up guidelines for the cemetery industry to follow if they're going to tell the public that they provide green burial.  It's a certification council. Their certification has also extended to funeral homes. So if a funeral home wants to attract an eco-conscious consumer they will go through the application process and will be providing eco-friendly products and services. Ok, so you teach workshops that teach people how to care for and prepare bodies for funerals and that's all done within their home? Yes.  I teach workshops to empower people to reclaim family and community run home funeral vigils. I'm trying to get away from the word funeral.  Because what we're really referring to is keeping a deceased at home under the guidance and care of a family with a funeral director either completely 100% out of the equation or in the equation. When the funeral director is in the equation, I refer to it as a hybrid funeral. But again, the purpose of my teaching is to empower people with the legalities of doing this work, the logistics of doing this work, and the practical dimensions. So the practical dimensions have to do with handling and safely handling a deceased, transporting a deceased in a vehicle, carrying a deceased, say unwrapping a deceased that comes from a hospital in plastic, the washing or cleansing of a deceased in the most highly, respectable, dignified way possible And there's so many nuances to this work. There's so many challenges. And I'd say the biggest challenge is just being present. And so in my training, it has evolved to the point where I say one of the most important dimensions of doing this, either by yourself or having a funeral director do the things you don't want to do, is self-care. And what I'm referring to is when you get anxious and other's you're working with, we do get anxious, we center ourselves through our breath and calm ourselves, relax the mind, open the heart, and go forward from there. And return to centering whenever it's necessary because it is a very sacred, even beautiful experience being present and lovingly tenderly caring for someone after death. In your experience, do you find that there is a link between I guess assuming the responsibility and the movement of caring, of processing, of holding this vigil and processing grief? You know, I want to make something clear. I have great experience as a funeral director over a period close to 15 years, meeting with tens of hundreds of grieving families, caring for tens of hundreds of deceased people/bodies.  As far as having a thriving practice of being a home funeral guide or being a death doula, it's been limited because the demand is not really strong and I don't have strong entrepreneurial skills in going out doing this doing that. My focus has been on taking my experience and training people to assume responsibilities of their own loved ones. But to answer your question about a link between this movement work, this activity of tenderly - tenderly assuming these responsibilities and tenderly caring for a loved one - and that effect upon one's grief. I don't think you have to have a lot of experience at all to understand that in moving and in caring and in being present to caring for a deceased, that the activity will start to dissolve your difficult emotions and so yes, there is a link. And I think it's very logical that when we do get involved in the way that I teach and what we're referring to here, yes, there will be healing.

You had mentioned that you had spent quite a bit of time as a funeral director in your 20s and 30s. What made you come back to, I guess, death work and why did you choose this green path instead. This idea of empowering people to do some of this work themselves? I came back to this funeral, this death work because after turning 50, I just had a strong realization that my time is running out and I want to engage myself in the most rewarding work and service work and my experience in my 20s and 30s was very rewarding. And so I was drawn back. And I decided that if I'm going to go back to death-related work because it is challenging, I was going to go back on my own terms.  And my own terms, they centered about health and well being. And as we know, the conventional funeral has a lot of elements that need to be ameliorated. And that's kind of a strange little word. But what I'm trying to say is that in a conventional funeral there is embalming and it's toxic and in most instances it's unnecessary. It's unnatural. There's the use of endangered resources be it mahogany caskets, be it cherry wood caskets, beautiful hardwood caskets. The funeral industry sells more metal caskets, just kind of pay attention when you're watching tv and you see these funerals, you see these metal caskets.  And in order to produce a metal casket you have to create metal so there's mining and the purification of iron ore, and all of the environmental stresses and pollution that's involved in making these metal caskets. So I decided that considering those elements plus the personal elements. And the personal elements in a conventional funeral are rather sedentary. In other words, we've developed a dependency upon professional funeral directors to support us with caring for a deceased. And that's ok, but we've become so dependent that we don't do much. And therefore, we don't work our grief through. We lose out on a very human task of continuing to care for someone we care for after death and reap all the benefits that come from doing that. And so I kind of put two and two together for myself and I realized that I was in a very good position with my background to train the public to assume these very human responsibilities. And so my work now is creating and leading the Home Funeral Practicum in Canada where students come to learn the legalities and the logistics and get practical experience in caring for a mock deceased. Because we can talk about legalities and logistics and how good this is and so on and so forth but it's in the doing that we really get the hands-on experience. And so my workshops are specifically task oriented. In other words, you either die at home and are cared for there or you die outside the home. And if you want to have a deceased brought back into the home, well certainly you can contract a funeral director to do it and there's nothing wrong with that. Or if you want to go off the grid, so to speak, you can actually, where it's legal in what province and what states it's legal you can actually do it yourself and gain the sense of sovereignty- this freedom to assume this very human responsibility. And then, either with a funeral director or yourself, bring a deceased into the home and doing cleansing and shrouding or dressing and laying out, whether in the bed for a couple of days or three days or maybe a day or in a casket or some other appropriate spot that really works, you have time to accept the death. You have time to grieve. You have this 24/7 opportunity to go into the bedroom where the person is laying in honor, or whenever in the house or in the casket or what have you, to do the work to say the things you want to say or to simply sit in their presence to absorb what has happened. So this whole thing about the home funeral vigil, home funeral movement, home funeral vigil experience is all about time to be present with the deceased in order to accept the finality and do so  in such a way that you move through a lot of grief. I have to apologize because I'm weeping as you're talking.  And I was fortunate enough to have that with my dad. And only going through one parent's death, I don't have anything to compare it to. But I did appreciate having a day to crawl in bed with him even after he had passed away to talk to him and hold his hands and to go back and brush his hair and rub oil on his body. And I believe that was very integral to how I perceived the event. So anyway I just wanted to say thank you for the work that you do because I don't... you don't hear people at least in this culture, talking about death and the role of death as a human activity. It seems to always be a scary - uh - it just has such a negative connotation. And given that it's something that we will all experience ourselves, both while we are living and then something that's inevitable, I just appreciate that you are speaking about it and also the way that you are speaking about it.  So about your workshops, logistically are they one day? Or is it a weekend or a week long? What's the logistics behind how someone, if they're interested, could come to you and what you teach? 
========,9,title.
First of all, my heart goes out to you for what you've been through with your dad and the strength you have in sharing this on this interview. I'm honored by you in this way. As far as my workshops go, the logistics, we meet Friday night for a movie and discussion and get to meet the other participants. And then we do all day Saturday and Sunday from 9 to 5. And we really need another day or at least another half day but I am doing my best to refine my offering so it's efficient. I don't offer multiple levels. I don't offer certifications. I provide a very valuable manual so that when people leave there is all the information they need in there. And I want people to know that this work is very simple. Right. And you can do it.  And you can't do it alone. And you shouldn't do it alone. So now that opens up a whole other discussion. If this work is too much to do alone then obviously we have to do it in relationship and we have to do it in community. And we don't have these structures in our culture because we're no longer tribal. We're no longer communal. However, there are communities, intentional communities, spiritual communities, religious communities that do care for their own in death. But for the rest of us it's really difficult.  And so for myself, I'll give you an example somewhat of a solution for myself. I have been participating in a men's circle for almost 6 years and we meet every other Thursday and we have between 8 and 12 of us. So I'm well bonded. We're all well bonded. And we've reached a point maybe a year ago where I said, and others said, you know we're capable of caring for each other as we die and after death. And lets just commit to that. So there's a circle I've educated. I've put on a weekend training for these brothers of mine.  And I'm going to be doing it for a particular church community in Victoria. And so this is kind of the direction this needs to go in because we can't do it alone and, I mean if you're grieving the loss of someone you shouldn't really be in there. It energetically, emotionally, psychologically, be in there do all of this work because it could be too much and generally for most all of us, it is too much. And so it's important to be part of a community that has training. I was just thinking in my mind, we live in a small town and we definitely have a community - not an intentional community. We're not really bonded in any particular paradigm as much as we just see each other so regularly and share so many of life things: meals, parenting strategies, fiscal responsibility, car lending, all these things... and it just occurred to me. One of us could go take this training and one of us could at least, for the other 50 or 60 people in this group, kind of at least facilitate. To almost be ... it wouldn't be the same as actually training with you directly or receiving the training but it would definitely help, you know, in have at least taking a glimpse at all of the options. So I like the idea that it can be done in a community in whatever way you personally define community. Yes. And you know, when I started doing this work 3 years ago, I didn't want to do it alone as a teacher and so I began with a colleague of mine. And she prefers to remain anonymous because she's changed her line of work. Back then people were very concerned, is it legal?  That's pressing. So what I do is I just make copies of public documents and laws and regulations that govern care of the dead and filing documents and transporting documents and I show it. That was the major concern. Is it legal? And if we're to do it ourself then tell us where do we go to file the paperwork? How do we - what kind of request do we make to get hold of the death certificate and the permit for burial and cremation and the transport. That was big and it still is a core part of my work. However, a lot of people who focus in on this work or this responsibility have gotten beyond the legality of it.  And what they really want from my training is they want the hands-on experience of being present to a mock model. And I'll tell you these mock models they play dead very well. And the handling. The turning. And being present and centering oneself. And the dressing. And the vigiling. And I have to share, even though we do these mock exercises, when everybody is so focused and so loving and so caring and keeps on returning to center, when we just stand before this mock deceased, the silence that comes over, the energy that comes over is precious. Is from a spiritual point of view, divine. It's almost as if the portal between this world, the physical world, and the spiritual world opens. And isn't that the truth about the great transition into this world; birth. Doesn't the portal open? And then the great transition to the spiritual world; death. The portal opens.  So I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the work that we're all doing reclaiming family and community death care is in alignment with our deepest self. With the ground of our being. With the creative force of life that existed before creation even happened. It's very real, healing work. And I'm so thrilled that our, here in North America, we are getting into this because we're going to influence our children and generations to come in a positive way so they live less death neurotic lives and more life positive lives with death in its proper place and their relationship to death in a healthy place. Don, I want to thank you so much for being my guest on Move Your DNA, but also just for being a great human doing necessary work ultimately that serves many beyond you.

We got an email a few weeks ago from a group called Wild Grief who wrote to us about stacking movement, grief, and nature and we were intrigued. I'm so glad to have a chance to talk today with Breanna Trygg who is a collaborative consultant and had been volunteering with grieving children for over 15 years and considers grief support her heart work. Breanna is a founding board member of Wild Grief and the current board president where she can combine her passion of supporting grieving kids and connecting with nature. Breanna, welcome to Move Your DNA. Hi Katy! Thanks for having me on. So I am just ecstatic to hear about what you offer and checked out what you offer and your Instagram right away because I felt like I had stumbled upon this idea of grief being a natural movement so I'm always relieved when other people have been thinking about things long before I have. So I want to talk with you today about Wild Grief. And let's start with what helped you make the connection between grief and movement and why did you start offering Wild Grief camps? That's kind of an interesting and long story. I'll tell you the short version. Basically, the founders of Wild Grief had a few things in common. We'd all experienced the death of an important person in our lives either in our childhood or in adulthood or as parents and we'd all been volunteering to support kids and families who were grieving which is where we met. And then we all kind of independently had a deep connection to nature. That was a really important part of our life. And in that volunteer work that we do with the support groups and the camps for grieving kids, we notice that the times where those kids were outdoors, their grief work really took on a new dimension. And there was something about it that just seemed kind of more transformational. And we had, also, our personal experiences of being outdoors, having that kind of hike, physical, exertion be a kind of deeper kind of connection to our inner selves and our inner grief. So we really wanted to spend more time and put more attention on that aspect of being outdoors and depending on your body to move you place to place and take care of yourself. And then one other piece, because we've been working in particular with teens over time, it can be very challenging to convince a group of teens to come sit into a room and talk with strangers about grief and hard stuff but having something where they're going backpacking, they're learning a skill, they're being outdoors, takes a little of that pressure off and gives them a lot more space to be able to share what they want and what they need to when they're ready. It's so interesting because I've always thought of grief support as talking as being the essential part of the process. So do you think that there's also something intrinsic in this movement of walking, and I'm not sure - we can talk a little bit more if you're backpacking or is this day hikes. Is it the group dynamic that's helping these grievers, maybe specific these teens move through this experience? Is talking necessary? Or is it all of it combined? 
========,9,title.
Yeah, those are really great questions. So basically talking is a piece of the process but it's not the only thing. And I would say it has some limits. And one of the ways we think about it to really to learn and to make meaning you really need to have some physical, kind of multisensory experience to be able to do that work. You really need sensory input, a personal emotional connection, and movement to really learn and remember something. And we talked a lot about grief is the ultimate learning experience of learning who you are, what your mortality is, learning what it means to have someone close to you die, there's so much learning and integrating you need to do. So just trying to do that in our brains doesn't really work. So what we do with Wild Grief, we have a couple different programs. Every month we do a hike habit. And that is the second Sunday of every month we have a two-hour walk in rain or shine in parts local to us in the south Puget Sound region.  And that experience we begin - we bring people together. We begin with an opening circle and people get a chance to share why they're there that day.  Who they're remembering or what part of the grief journey that they're on. And then the first 10 minutes of the hike are really walking in silence together as a group. And we ask everyone to kind of honor that silence as a group. Which is a different experience than silence walking by yourself. And then after that 10 minutes, it's very interesting. Some people stay in silence, some people move into small group conversations and they talk about everywhere from their really intense grief experience to what else they're doing that weekend. Right?  There's no real prescriptive piece about it but it's a chance to acknowledge we're here together, talk about our grief, walking through our grief. And then we come back and we have a closing circle and we leave. It's just really - it's amazing to see the transformation even with just a two-hour experience has for the people because there's something about acknowledging that we're carrying this big heavy thing and we're going on this grief journey together. And then actually physically take a journey together - even if it's a short one - you can really see it in people's faces and in their affects over the courses of those two hours. So that's kind of our regular program and then we do a day hike, usually one in the spring and one in the fall which is just more the extended version of that. So we go somewhere like Mount St. Helens or Mount Rainier and we take a whole day to spend together, have lunch together, really make it kind of a longer, bigger experience with a few more activities.  And those too are for all community members so all ages. And then we also do youth programs which is for ages 13-19 which is a backpacking trip where we do teach the skills of really learning to be backpackers to move your bodies to take care of yourself in the wilderness in addition to addressing your grief. And that one, again, talking is a piece of that process  but there are a lot of other things that we do and activities that we do that help people move through that. And I think the richness in an experience like that is the metaphor that you can draw from the actual experience of doing that work. We're not asking for experienced backpackers to come on those trips for those teens and we supply all the gear and material. So they don't have to worry about coming up with all that stuff. So for example, the first day our theme is grief is hard and it can hurt and it can be discouraging. And that first day on the trails as they're heading uphill, probably for someone on their very first backpacking experience, carrying this heavy pack and trying to figure out what it means to sleep outside ... so we are really trying to make those links between the physical experience and what can feel like to be in grief. It really opens up a lot more avenues to explore what grief is and how to normalize it for those kids. I've been nodding so much my neck is sore. I can hear my brain is synthesizing things that I've learned at nature awareness school and things that I've learned working with various occupational therapists about sensory integration and medium of nature. And then this - it's not a metaphor - it's that we're often not used to doing things that are hard and moving through those processes in the modern life context - to kind of live out the physical not related to your grief experience and you're like, "oh, I've gone from unsuspecting to hard to surviving" and you just keep doing that over and over again until you get skilled at it. So thank you for tying all those pieces together for me. Mm-hmm. My next question was, I think something that you already answered but maybe there's some other elements to tease out here: What have you observed from the teens and adults who are participating in the group hikes. And I'm not sure if it's like what are the changes for them?  Maybe clinical measures perhaps, but is there anything self-reported or observations that you've made about people who have attended these Wild Grief gatherings?Yeah, so we've had so far, because we're a pretty new organization, we've only had the day hikes and the hike habit. And this summer's our first time with teens. But I can tell you a little bit about what I've seen on our hike habits and our day hikes. And I did mention it a little bit but it's really interesting to me, and one of our, kind of our vision with Wild Grief, is to create a vital, resilient, and connected community with a healthy response to death. And one of the ways we do that is that kind of normalization of death is a part of our life even though in our western culture we try not to admit that. Right. We put it in a box.  And it's something that happens to someone else. Until you're really in it and then you can feel really lost and lack of support. So I think for that one of the things we've really noticed is people arrive at the trailhead for a hike habit or a day hike and you can feel that nervous energy where a group of people who don't know each other, they're coming together, and they're gonna be talking about this big personal thing of they're in pain. Which is not something we share with anyone most of the time, much less a group of strangers.  And so that sense, watching that as the arrival and the kind of nervous funny giggles, right? And just in that opening circle moment when they share that piece and you see the almost physically like a thread of connection between all these people. Where they all have a story. And they don't necessarily tell the story but it's just an acknowledgment that they're holding that story. And then just that kind of movement, it just opens up that space for people to dive into those deep conversations. So you can be walking along someone on the trail talking about what you had for breakfast and then all of a sudden you can be like "And then my dad died and it changed my whole relationship with food because he was a chef."  So you can just dive into this crazy thing. Yeah. And it's fine because you're together and acknowledging it. And there's something about walking next to someone versus this sitting down with them an looking them in the eye. That makes it a little more comfortable to be able to talk about that. Yeah. And then you can really see by the closing circle just the tension in people's bodies, partly from the walk and the actual movement but it just melts away and they experience some of that emotion but because there was that forward motion, you don't have that feeling of getting stuck. So by the end of the hike when we have our closing circle, whatever piece of emotion that they touched and brought up, they've kind of had that chance to move through it and hold it in a different way. And then by the end, they're just a little bit more relaxed. They're still holding this heavy thing of grief, but there was a chance to speak to it and a chance to connect with other people and with nature. Our last hike that I was a part of, we talked about that concept of forest bathing and just what a feeling it was. It was pouring rain that day too so kind of multidimensional forest bathing, but they just really have a sense of relaxation and kind of relief after going through just that two-hour experience. So our first backpacking trip this summer, we've all worked with kids in a lot of ways, the people who formed this group. But we haven't stacked those specific things of grief support and nature and movement and building their confidence in their bodies and what work they can do to take care of themselves and building that community. So I think that that ... our hope is that it's going to be one of the touchstone experiences for these kids for their life overall because I think it has the possibility to be transformational in a lot of ways. And transformational or even just a chance to spend four days with other people talking about this hard thing, it just gives you that space to explore it where we don't have that space when we're back in our day to day lives. It's so interesting that we use the term holding space. And it's often such a sedentary concept because it can mean a time, a chair in a room, eye to eye contact. The idea that holding space can literally be wide open space, I think is a different way of thinking about this term. And certainly it applies in all the context but I'm just thinking now of therapeutic scenarios that I've been in and it's so much eye to eye, direct, uncomfortable, sometimes. Yes. It can be intimidating to have to kind of deal with these very deep things. Someone is making eye contact with you and looking and waiting expectantly. And also with kids, my own kids, having lots of siblings, that face to face can sometimes be defense making - maybe just naturally - maybe direct eye contact can read that way for some animals in certain states... Right. If I walk alongside my kids and they're just doing their own thing, they're much more likely - or my partner - for that matter - much more likely to just allow things to come up because I don't feel like I'm being confronted. It's just more space to facilitate this babbling brook of whatever comes up.  So I like the idea of the bigger the therapy office, so to speak, the more it can fill because the more directions everything and everyone can go. You had also mentioned this notion of self-care. And this has come up for me a few times. Grief is, I think, such a sedentary experience. I mean if you think about it in movies it can be, you know, drawn curtains. Everyone in the house is sitting. Maybe not even getting out of bed when you're really in the depths of grief. So self-care - even the most basic things like going outside and being in the sunshine or in a rain forest, perhaps, or simply moving your body, I think that, or I'm wondering are these being viewed as self-indulgent at a time when you are supposed to be grieving. Do you think that there's this feeling that you're not honoring others - in this case, your departed - in some way if you continue to attend to your own needs, to care for and about yourself Right. I think there's a lot to that idea. And of the having to just put all your attention on the person who died and closing up. And I think a part of that is in our western culture we've lost some of those, I think in America in particular, we've lost kind of that sense of ritual around specific things. Or what is the work that you do around grief? Because we're very individualistic and so we've just kind of, you've got to be strong. You got to not show that you're vulnerable. And you just don't have a job to do.
========,9,title.
So what are the tasks of grief? What is it that you need to do to honor that? And I think that's part of what we're pushing back on. That caring for yourself is a primary way of honoring the person who died. It's allowing your feelings to move as you move and you're furthering your relationship with them by creating that new way of relating to them. And I would say with the work that we're doing, we're not therapists. I mean we have some trained counselors and mental health professionals who work with us but our program isn't a therapist sitting down with kids. It's community member, peer support model. So it's about being together with others who are experiencing the same thing and being able to just discuss that - be in the moment. So we're not trying to fix the grief so we don't feel sad, or overwhelmed, or angry. But it's this idea of giving the grief arms, and legs, and eyes, and ears to be able to express it in a way that develops some sort of ritual that you can go back to. Because grief in our experience is not like a one and done. "Oh I'll just do this thing and I'll be done and I can check that bar." My dad died when I was 8 and I'm in my 30s now, and it's still an experience that comes up for me. When my son was born, or when I got married, or when I had a success in my career that I don't get to share that with my dad - so I'm still grieving. Even all these years later but it just changes over time. So what are those rituals and community connections that we can build so that we can honor that grief journey and be able to be vulnerable with each other and move into that self-care space and not kind of wall off or just try to be that strong stoic person. Yeah, I think that the work that you're doing is fantastic.  I just feel like there's minds exploding all over as people listen to the work that you're doing. It really seems to be tying many threads together: vitamin nature, and grief work, and holistic approaches, and ancestral health, and all these community pieces that we're re-integrating slowly over time. I definitely want to point listeners to your website, to your Instagram. Do you have any other resources that you feel are exceptional? I think, there aren't a ton of programs specifically like ours where that very driven nature and grief but there are other places where you can find grief support specifically for children and families that I think would be great for people to be able to look up all over the country. So for example, the National Alliance for Grieving Children has a list of programs that you can connect with all over the country. And there are places like the Moyer Foundation which funds Camp Aaron which is a camp for kids who are grieving and that happens in a lot of places across the country as well. And that gets ... I think Camp Aaron is where we really got inspired because we saw those kids in an outdoor context and we just wanted more and more of that. So I think those places would be great resources. And of course I have a million so I can share a few of those for your show notes so people can look up and see what might be helpful for them. Thank you so much. Thank you for taking time away from your very important work to come speak with me on this podcast. Thank you so much, Katy. It was fun to talk this through with you.
