Johann Hari, I got it right you said it might you're literally the first person to come forward to just assume that was you when you hurry her Joanne Herring like I just thought I felt like I wasn't even drunk texting stories Hadley. So give me your if you had like a one-paragraph take on depression. Sure. What is your take on depression? So this is why I write this book lost connections uncovering the real causes of depression and anxiety in the real solutions site.I want to understand why does depression and anxiety depression anxiety seems to be rising sign a personal to me explain the sense of pain and tell me a biological story just said basically brains broken at all. He did was give me drugs, right and drugs Road in treating people. I was so depressed that time I was taking these drugs right most of the time and after 13 years ago after I need to understand what's really going on here turned into being the leading experts in the cupboard is the which hold a ridiculously simplistic story to people about depression is and how to solve that that you know until I was a teenager I went to my depression is all in my head meaning, you know, you just been weak beta pussy by Saturday and then the next thirteen years. I thought it was all in my head meaning, you know basic chemical imbalance in your brain while I discovered it isWelding evidence from the World Health Organization leading medical body in the world like to other places. Is there a real biological factors that can make you more sensitive to this stuff are the causes of depression anxiety in the way. We're living there These Hoes has depression anxiety, which I could find scientific evidence 7 which in the way we're living and some of which are rising which explains this kind of different wave Funding Solutions. Now when you were young and you were experiencing depression, how would you categorize it? Like what how would you describe it? If you had to describe you to someone who didn't understand depression. I think I think depression depression is despair spreading everyone has moments of Hope business in that lives. Right? It's not spreading is a deep wave thinking about this, which is everyone listen to this everyone watching. This knows that they have natural physical needs right you need food. You need water in a clean a guinea.Things away from you. You would be real trouble real fast right have natural psychological needs right you go to feel you belong you go to fill your life has meaning and purpose you go to fill the people. See you and bother you. You you go to feel that you go telling me you got to feel that you got a future that makes sense and I'll coach was good at lots of things. I'm glad to be alive today, but I'll culture has been getting less and less good meeting these deep underlying psychological needs a lots of people and that is the key reason to learning about the key reason why we have this Rising depression anxiety in specific examples if you want, okay sure you want it sample. I noticed the loss of the people I know it was depressed and anxious that depression and anxiety fucks his around that work right start to think what's going on here. So I stopped to look for evidence how people feel about that work best research on this was done by Gallup the opinion poll company massive detailed study to a couple of years. They found the biggest how people feel about work in the US Senate.Of comfortable countries. Will they found is 13% by was one 3% basically like all what most of the time we get energy from it 63% about was what they called Sleep working. So white they worked that hate they wet cuz I just kind of internet and 24% of people fucking hate that work right there and read it so I don't like the thing that doing most of the time that I'm credible email at 7:48 a.m. And leaves work at 7:15 p.m. Most about waking Lions. We doing something we don't like I start to think could that be some connection between that and this epidemic anxiety depression addiction Australian social scientist by got tonight who discovered the key to what causes theRussian at work right this how we discovered it. If you want something amazing story about the core of it is if you go to work and you are controlled she feel you have low or no control you are radically more like it to become depressed. You're even more likely to have a stress-related heart attack. I don't think the reason is clear that it does keeping things me to put on Lifetime meaning right and if you control the time you don't feel like your life has meaning you don't feel like you just dropped your ability to create meaning out of your work and it makes you feel like shit right that make sense. What are things so important to me and everything I was learning connections was my mind cuz why was basically told by my doctor raised your pain is a malfunction, right? He said, you know, we know what causes depression it's just some people naturally have low levels of serotonin in the brain.You know, you'll clearly wanted them at. That's what's going on. He had a speaking to the sleigh not really a professor Andrew Scarlett Princeton University says it's deeply misleading and unscientific decide depression is just caused by lice are tied in Riley's snow tree and 150 snowing real causes of depression and anxiety was realizing I don't truly I'll pay you make sense. Right? If you're depressed. If you are anxious, you've been told basically that you will a bit crazy. There's something not working but actually, you know machine with broken parts write you a human being with unmet needs. I'm not require a different set of responses. So you think about anything but right most people feel they couldn't control it work with low control and it's making them feel terrible that it wrong to feel that right, but God made us human beings and it's not being mad.

How can we deal with this?Strategy to deal with this not to sling some people be able to do as individuals, but it's something we can actually changes in society. So far more people could do that. I went to Baltimore and interviewed a woman young woman has to go to bed every Sunday night. Just fucking sick with anxiety, right? She would she would tend office job wasn't the west of his job in the world age was being harassed but she just felt like she just come bad for the next 40 years of my life. We're going to be this right. I'm one day with her husband Josh. She is quite the thing working class guy from Baltimore since he was a teenager heed heed what to bike stores and in a bike store reviews will know it's insecure. It's controlled you do it boss tells you that you get vacation The Last of Us is nice to you and I didn't hateWhat's up, boss actually do right we fix old bikes and he seems to make her the money. What's what's going on are they decided to do an experiment that they stopped at a different bike store rival bike stores, Baltimore Bicycle Works on a different principle. So I might people will listen to this will work in corporations. Right shutdown. You do what the boss says. It's more like an army that is a very recent human invention right side Salon in the late 19th century. What they did was try different Democratic cooperatives. So I bought him a Bicycle Works. They take all the big decisions together about their web. They vote at a sheriff out. The guitar asks in the shity Tesla. No one just get stuck with all the shity * X they share the profits obviously so they control their environment together like a little tribe that control the environment instead of an army with one guy at the top controlling it. I want a sub so fascinating spending time with them just totally in finding the person Michael Mom. It's research what causes depression at what is how many of them talked about having been really depressed and anxious?When they were when they working in this controlled way and that depression and anxiety had lost you to go to stop at days ago. Kind of nagging depression and anxiety had gone away in this different environment. And if there's no reason why any business should work in this talk down controlled way that makes people depressed. It's not even more fish in a study at Cornell University China democratic businesses grow full times faster than Van Damme businesses about depression sad depressed and anxious people the job of fixing this is basically on your body right maybe if you're lucky your family, maybe if you're lucky your daughter, but actually once you begin to realize that the reasons why people are depressed and anxious make sense to just one of many reasons why people are depressed and anxious feeling addiction crisis we can talk about if you want and what you got is it makes sense you suddenly realize what you going to do is deal with the problem in the world as well as the problem just in the individuals.Yes, you're focusing on work environments, right? And there's there's many reasons as you were saying for four people being depressed up have you when you talk about work environments? Have you researched people who are independent people work for themselves people who we don't make things or make furniture. What have you removed from the product that what right from the outcome if that what to give an example of the guy I interviewed a lot of paint store, right and judge job is to 10 up at whatever it was 8:30 in the morning. Stay that way all day until 7 p.m. I just take your order the pain and then when you ask for specific shade, his job is to put in a machine that shook it right, just give you the type that was his whole life week after week year after year was acutely depressed and I was really really guilty about telling me how depressed.That's right. I can't sign look under how lucky I am. I know how lucky I am. I bet you felt like felt like sharing anything except I've been saying to me look, I know people need paint right? It's not I know that have some function going to be today in Piqua like that. But this is not giving me any since I made it one of the real Mysteries to me about Joe at the. I had to learn about one of the other causes of depression and anxiety and solutions to that was such a lot of people with some of my relatives you do work like that that basically the margin for them to change the locks is really narrow struggling single mom, you know, she's she wakes every hour she can she get something today collapses, right. I do the same to her your job now is to democratize your what place is ridiculous, right? She can't do that. That's why most of us connect. This is how we can change the couch to free people up to make the changes. They need to make sure that they're all things individuals can do like I threw in the book, but the but but the theA lot of people should I put it? They say we live in such an individualistic culture. The people think what you're saying is you need to do it yourself with Joe was in an unusual position in that Joe loves fishing rod 20 of the 50 states. How do you recently been to Florida? I need to know when I was in, Florida. I am I realized I could just quit this job. I could go to live as a fisherman in Florida. I'd make less money. I'd be much happier. Right and if somehow I knew years I was talking to be supplied. I knew he wasn't going to go to Florida right to know the way he said it was a wistful longing musical idea not something based on a real possibility of somebody to buy play it. But remember the last time I saw him, I will talk like a complete dick for doing this alone people trapped in the way our culture works, which is why I'm going to change the culture and I talked about specific concrete things that happened tried in other countries have free people up and have reduce depression. So she will get tonight, but you think about an individual what's going on that one of things I learned at fence amazing Professor Tim Casa in Illinois and Knox College in Illinois is I think one of the things from the heart What is a depression to learn about cuz I realize how much it played out in my own life as well? So junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick write something similar has happened with all mind kind of junk value to take a never mind what I can start learning about this. I remember it ain't nothing but junk food for like 10 years in my twenties basically and I'm Amber one day. It makes the story even sounded it was Christmas Eve in 2009 at lunch time. I went to my local KFC and I would accept my order which I buy a prepaid 6 or so I discussed and the guy behind the counter said was so glad you're hair appointment with it, but it went back and he came out and the whole story fat fucking massive Christmas card for me and they bring it to our best customer a mohawk. But Sunday is a look at this. It's only realized it supposed to eat in the Fried Chicken shop. I went to the most right That works right junk food appeals to the part of us that evolved nutrients but it tricks not it's not actually make you sick right now. This is a simple things happening on mine. So we played some thousands of years. Said if you think life is about you no money and status and shoving off you going to feel like shit, right, but it's not exact quote from Confucius best to just do what you said, right, but weirdly know what it actually scientifically investigated this until until price of gas at 25 years ago in you that bass Elite speak. Rudely. There's two kinds of motives that human beings have right you call them.

I put them James going everyone Scotland, right and defense that much is a matching match with you play the piano music imagine. He played the piano in the morning cuz you love it and it gives you Joy that's cool intrinsic mode. How to play the piano right you're not doing it to get anything out of it you just doing it cuz you love it, right. The experience is the point play the piano and I don't like it right you play the piano cuz your parents really want you to be a piano monster. Why does a woman is really into pnsc you learn the piano tuned process that would be an extrinsic reason to play the piano. You're not doing it for the thing itself to get something out of it. Right and it's a pretty important things about these things. But we move throughout our lives. We discovered more you are driven by extrinsic values. The Mortal life is Guided by how you look to the outside by you know, what you're trying to get out of life Broughton enjoying it the more you will become depressed and anxious by quite a large margin the lights in studies that show this and that we have become much more obsessed with much Motrin by these over the last 30 years. Spartacus for the minute we born with most of the machine that tells us life is about consumption right by externally can see me that's more 18 month old children knows what the McDonald's and means the know the ride last night, right? So this this machine constantly get to it's getting us to think extra fine, right? You don't need to buy anything today that would fit a prospective the advertising industry be the worst West. But I don't buy anything. So this movement to what these kind of junk found any shows lots of reasons why these junk values make us feel like shit one is it just corrodes the quality of your relationships, right? If your wife if you think your wife loves you because you're you. Because you're rich because you look good or for some other reason than think about the insecurities that enters into that relationship. You know, I write you something to eat or if you suddenly lost all your money. Play that creates sand in security and to order a relationship or extrinsically motivated the more insecure your relationships fail or another example would be something that really makes human beings feel good or what cold flow States right that moment when you're doing something you love to me. It's writing for you. I'm sure it's probably broadcasting probably working out as you can see it. No way I could have for me at that where you just get into the zone and time seems to collapse and you're in that moment, right? But what am I thinking extrinsically what being dominated by these junk bodies does of the intrinsic by imagine you play the piano just cuz you love it and then suddenly you think I'm only the best piano player in Los Angeles today, right? How are these people in this room thinking about my piano planks? How much are we getting paid for this piano play you can see how that would go you out of the flow state right people in the more we get into flow states in the west we felt. Well that completely makes sense that relying constantly on other people's approval and recognition and love in order for you to be satisfied and happy but it isn't is not a good recipe for getting by in this life smoothly. When you were young and you were experiencing depression. Well, as you called it, what was the root cause of it said my case it was a few things going on and she talked about but what are the people like tonight for the Lost connections? Is this amazing. Vincent felitti in San Diego and white dining room lights. Myself and actually why I was very resistant to this situation very resistant to this Insight that he had made this discovery in a whole other subject, but trust me. I think it gets to depression Electra incredible breakthrough depression to the mid-1980s. If the ladies doing all this Research into IBC Play some Kaiser Permanente or not-for-profit medical provider down in San Diego. Just had a massive fucking problem with obesity. Right there is just a huge Me growing problem today and they were trying everything and nothing was wet. Like you do people nutritional advice. I said you wasn't working right so I basically said to him like I didn't quite think about you and I like just figure out what the hell is going on here. So he went away and he started to work but it was about 350 extremely obese people right people to buy more than 400 lb and I stupidly simple. What if they just literally stopped eating and we gave them the nutrients they need to eat what they just lose right away and then come down to healthy white. So they obviously be like massive medical supervision. They did this right people. They just wanted to them and I stopped eating and they give them legs of vitamins and everything. What right they did in fact leave slow to wait, but then something happened to No One expected the woman. I'm going to call Susan at 2 medical confidentiality shipping up a 400 lb, she go down to 138 pounds on one and everyone celebrating. I think Vincent's like a miracle worker and then one day she freaks the fuck house. Message me obsessively eating and very quickly. She's back to know quite what she wants maclise, right? I think since it's your season and he's like what happened? I don't know. I just tell me about the day you cracked right to happen to her that in a long time a man hit on her right when she been you know, she shed waiting them out of hell. Nah man held her and that was the trigger trying to sound like hey, so they took that you started to hurt when she was 11. When you were living it didn't happen when you pretend it didn't happen when you were 12 or 15 and she said oh, well, that's what my grandfather started raping me. I need the sweetie start with him and say stop talking to the Grave. I just got to 55% of the extremely overweight people in the grave from the grave after being sexually abused right which is extraordinary for more than this is Susan said to him was overlooked and that's why I wanted to be bright-eyed look like a pathology. Right and is a pathology one sense being stranded white will kill you suddenly didn't look like a sign of Madness. It was actually performing a function that we couldn't see right it was it was it was protecting them from sexual tension, but you know, this is a small group Studies have been somewhat. It's got a lot more research on his way through depression saying set it up with funding for the CDC to set up a Disease Control kind of gold plated organization in this in the US this kind of research everyone who came to Kaiser Permanente. In the next year or anything with migraines you had schizophrenia anyting will give it a question that I asked about any of these 10 bad things happen to you when you were a kid right to be sexual abuse neglect that kind of thing. And then it says have you had any of these problems as an adult obesity injecting drug use the last minute they added to depression right by luck. So when they get the results back to CDC would just like what the fuck is this you are radically more likely to become depressed. If you had six of those categories see what 3100 percent more likely to be attempted suicide as an adult if you were if you have six thousand six hundred percent Milwaukee to become an auto injecting drug use a right and does it to buy that why this is I'm going to be on Vincent says now open them what the sign says and this comes Experience so I had when I was a kid, I expect some very extreme acts of violence Ronaldo in my family and my mother have been very ill when I was a kid. My dad was my country and I expect he's really really extreme frightening facts about it's an eye. Some stupid but until I went to see Vincent if you would have asked me do you think that played a role in your depression? I would have said no, right and it makes me realize one of the reasons why I clung to this very simplistic chemical imbalance theory of depression for so long. Because I did not want to give the individual rights are pulling me towards me that sense of power over me. I didn't want to I don't want to think about that stuff. I want a culture has a I wanted to cut it out of my life quotes about cats not like I missed you. But you know, the reason why I stayed with this in the reason why I kept in San Diego on the reason why I kept going with all these different causes depression anxiety is cuz once you understand what's happened, you can find Solutions otherwise there but there's a second stage of Benson.

Abilities research that Sammy was so powerful Twins versus white must have talked about this now so that you'd experienced the next time you went back to your doctor you went cold back. The next time you went to a doctor your daughter was told to say something to you like hard drive. I see on the form you indicated that you bought an ABS when you were a child. I'm really sorry that happened. She that should never have happened. Would you like to talk about it. People said thank you, but no I don't want to talk about that people. Did Once Upon a verdict in 5 minutes and then the doctor said I can refer you to a therapist to talk more about this if you want and they wanted to see what happened the results for kind of incredible. There was a peaceful and depression anxiety therapist or even bigger fool and it seems to be against this is going to be on Benson said last message. I think probably what happens is it related to shame right? If you are a kid and you experience some kind of abuse You can come by if you want to do things, right you can either say look on Fox head, right? I'm like a pinball base might try to pinball machine cuz I can't stop this happening and I just got to accept you can say this must be my food with some level, right? And which is why I did it anyway, but almost every case. I'm a weird thing is if you tell yourself that you a fool, actually you gain a sore with internal power, right? You're not the pimp movies not run the machine, you're the best and control the penalty. If you can change your behavior, right, You can charge of the present. I bet you could have developed this kind of shame. I wanted things we know is plenty of evidence from this people at the passage in Panabaker of showing it shame is a catastrophe for human psychology right that we know for example, openly gay men died two years later than closeted gay men in the age crisis, even when they got Medical Care at the same time right shame destroys you it makes you sick and Vincent found was this model of releasing your shame. Would you like to the significant for remember one of the Lexus he got was from an old woman that she was in the 80s or just said she had been sexually abused when she was a kid, and she said thank you for asking. I thought I died and no one would ever know. And you can see how that release of Shame would have a transformative effect on people. Wow, so for you you had this traumatic experience of violence when you were young you were depressed. You were trying to figure out what the source of this was whether it was some sort of a chemical imbalance in your brain when when they say chemical imbalances in the brain. Are they capable of measuring the level of serotonin in your brain? Yes soon as the autopsy is is a big debate about but that's when someone's dead. Yeah. So this seems to be most scientists agree not all of them in there some people who descend from this but most scientists agree low serotonin correlates with depression right bicep stretch marks correlate with obesity, but they don't say that. I think I should be described as chemical imbalances but one is really shocking to me was one of the British expats in this talk to David. Healy said to me you can't even say the idea that depression. Serra Toyota in Yukon even say that. Theory is discredited cuz it was never credited there was never a time with her for the scientist in the field believe that right. The reason that story goes out to me and most people listening to this in the nineties is what really well for the drug companies, right? Because what makes it sound like if you just got a chemical imbalance the solution is just to give you chemicals do payroll. We can measure that and this is what he wants point to make about this which is so depression is measured by something cool to Hamilton's got robbed always felt. Sorry for the weather Hamilton was the guys from one where you are, you know, don't sit around in next to Save-A-Lot on ecstasy. It's 51 when you would be acutely suicidal, right and Hamilton scale looks like if you move six points on the Hamilton Sky. Oh, that's right. Sleep patterns get better. You'll gain 6 points on the Hamilton scale. I need your sleep patterns to tear right? So you had a baby's crying all the time. Snooze 6 points on Hamilton Scott Wright Medical School to the best research unless he found this on average chemical antidepressant smooth people 1.8 points on the Hamilton scale previously patents does an average sized some people to get more than that. Some people get less and you can see 1.8 points is not nothing right. If you can't be suicidal 1.8 points can take the edge off that's real. Even giving people that relief but it's not solving the problem for most people only thought I was in a weird but being on antidepressants for so long remaining depressed turns out I was totally typical country. Steve ilardi is Professor psychology between 65 and eighty percent of people taking him again. She can see that's not a hundred percent that is some value is not that's with Abilify is for right is Abilify the idea that your antidepressant is not enough. So you take Abilify on top of your antidepressant which is Close to help you in further. And it's one of the most prescribed medications in the country and it's an anti-psychotic is terrifying in a Lifetime right? It's a sign of a cultural Madness that we're doing this right where the Nazis not said that I would stress again. There was a real value in these drugs. There's somebody to them there's side value of them, but they most certainly over-prescribed and there's smoke certainly actual methods that you could use to improve your life without any sort of chemical intervention that are readily available to everybody like exercise and diet. Yeah, why can't you go to sleep but those things aren't stressed when you when you go to a doctor. The first thing the doctor doesn't say is listen to We need to do is get you start running and get you start eating really healthy and then we'll talk about antidepressants is a 10 billion dollar industry in that. Don't take any new Drugs That's a crazy number. Yes, a billion dollars primary and the most people only options at Wendy's already helped me change think about this different it fits exactly what you're saying Joe is 20 hp.

The South African psychiatrist go dark Summerfield and Eric happened to be in Cambodia when chemical antidepressants were first introduced right? That's where they were injured energy. He was just I just think about the other day. I thought I was the one of the Lost countries in the world. They made that white chick and didn't know what they were right about. What is this? And he explained a nice said I would prefer to go on antidepressants and he said what do you mean by some kind of like hairball Remedy or something instead? They told him a story. There was a farmer in that community may one day went to the rice fields a one-day it stood on a landmine goes like blown off. So I went back to work in the rice fields preparing a super painful to work in water when you likes to get everyone Out official. Let me like I don't guess it is pretty traumatic cuz he's in the fields wife been blown up starts to cry all day doesn't want to get out bad classic depression, right? They said that we got him an antidepressant said, what was it? They said they explained they went and sat with him. They listen to him. They realize that his pain made sense. They realize that that should make Patterson said he felt so bad. They figured if they bought him a cow, he could become a Dairy Farmer. He wouldn't be in these fields way was being fought top sleep in the car within a couple of weeks. He stopped crying. I said to Derek CC. Dr. Kyle was an antidepressant. That's what you mean right. Now. If you'd been raised to think about depression the way we have been propagandize to that sounds like a bad joke where I went to my doctor put on to the person who gave me a cow if you understand all these experts. So I have been extensively have been trying to tell us to go to some of the World Health organization's been trying to tell us exactly what they knew through the science, which is a pain makes sense, right, you know crazy to feel like shit you go unmet needs and what you need his help to get your needs met at some of the things we're talking about all really good examples exercise. Some of them. Are these bigger intervention. So one of the Hammers I lost connection to start charcoal to Michael Sam every two. Is based in in East London IG right near where I live for a long time for pulpotomy East London and sadly he was never my doctor, but Sam was really uncomfortable General Practitioners general doctor lights of people were coming to help with depression and anxiety right has medical training, even though he knew the science was much more complicated than this to just say to people, you know, you just got chemical imbalance in the brain and just struck them, right and sounds like me he's not posted to some people but he just thought it's just this isn't dealing with it. Right so he tried a different approach you notice that one of the factors that was making me depressed and anxious was how profoundly lonely they work to study asked what is important but what's the study of Americans? How many close friends do you have here you could call on in a crisis when they started doing study years ago. The most common answer was fine today. The most common answer is none. What is the average but more people say nothing than any other options you think about that more people in America or more people in the United States have nobody to turn to when there's a crisis than any other option, right? She think about what life must be like when you're alone that is not the species. We are the reason why you and I sitting here driving Ally the reason why we were lying it's cuz our ancestors in Africa on the savannas of Africa thing, right? They would bigger than the animals they took down but they were much better at cooperating the animals. They took down we exist because I ancestor spooned into tribes every Instinct we have is to live in a tribe right bees need to hide humans need a tribe. We are the first humans ever to try to disband our tribes are no one's ever done that before and came in history and it's quite well. What do you let me stop you there cuz we're getting deep in the weeds here. What do you say to someone who is happy with what they do? Lives are filled by exercises and still depressed. I know people that worship at the altar of Science and modern medicine that firmly believe that all depression is because of some sort of chemical imbalance in the brain in anything that debates that or anything that disputes that notion is is it pisses them off I would have been like that for me. Of course I was stationed is the leading medical body in the world, right? They did a study of all the best evidence and explain very clearly that mental health is a social indicates a right as social causes any social Solutions as well as individual Solutions the science of overwhelming you won't get many scientists to say if I could be a struggle to find any scientist who said depression is purely a biological phenomenon. Pretty much everyone agrees this some social and psychological component. I think when we is Wade disconnect between what two scientists know what the public is told right? I didn't know anyone who went to the doctor who pop list one football 2017. You can talk about anything other than the therapist but no I was told about these wind up so she has no astrology field controls at work while it's fine. Could be making you make you depressed. You are depressed but don't get me wrong. I need people I thought about that one is the best reasons to research for something else. I was reading some light feminist text from the early 60s, right and a really common thing happened in the early sixties as women would go to that doctor and I talked to the something very wrong with my nerves people has nerves that we don't do that anymore because I got everything. I've got a husband beat me a washing machine to Kidz, Bop feel like shit right by the bus time is the Country Strong right as a as a woman is a human being you need more than just a washing machine in the car, right? You need Apple feeling like it's b a meaning and purpose of the price similar thing I think is happening today. So if you want to speak to people soccer everything I could want but I feel like shit. So tell me tell me about your life very often there working really hard in a prestigious jobs that I don't like but don't enjoy hour by hour to buy things but don't give them pleasure comes back to this hijacking Bhajan values that we talkin about the professor Tim Casa discovered.

So you go is because we've been told a totally misleading story about what makes a satisfied and happy as human beings. I just comes up again and again and then she's you too cuz you can tell in different ways because we've been told and misleading story about that. We live our lives according to the wrong script. We feel like shit about the question the script we think there must be something wrong with us biologically biological contributions it support sign up at one of these in my mind on this was a social scientist. Spratford in Berkeley. She did this research kind of simple research. It just asked If you consciously decided you were going to spend more hours a day trying to make yourself happier. Would you actually become happy that right? And I did this research change your lineup with our colleagues and the United States, Japan Russia and Taiwan consciously, you do not become happy in the other countries. If you try to make yourself happier, you do become a peer and they were like what's going on? So I did more research. What I discovered was in the US and if you try to make yourself happier, You trying to do something generally feel South you buy something for yourself you big yourself up yet try to get a promotion and the other countries. Generally if you try to make yourself happy you do something for someone else, right? You try to help your friends and family your community. What countries does Russia want to be happy you do something for someone else. Is it showing pussy in the culture that I live collectively that it's not even just like we wouldn't even if you said do you think happiness is an individualistic thing? We've been like what are you even talking about idea as well the idea that you're going to be happy by trying to make other people happy in what does think so intrinsic values and know about just entitled to a side of things that you value so you weren't you could be spending time with your kids right. Just intrinsic value of the parents is being with that kids bonding with that kids love my kids if your goal is to get happy in the way you've chosen to get Happy's I'm going to get happy by making other people happy. Let's see. That seems very strange. I think so. I know that you can think about where humans make other people happy because you love them but I see white loving people and being present with them as like a specific with a specific goal of making yourself happy that seems they have an implicit script in that culture is like a rock going to make myself happy all spend time with other people. I'll do things with other people. If you think about in terms of human evolution, it makes total sense, right think about our ancestors were they involved if you were a group of individuals throughout to pick up themselves as individuals, we wouldn't be having this conversation, right? So it makes a species with instincts the motivation of trying to get Happy by helping other people that just seems a China Did they wouldn't even articulate it that way so I can if you force them to try to make it so happy that they then the script becomes obvious. It's implicit. But this script that we have is I did it the way you make yourself happy individual, you know, just doing something for yourself and how you would hold out until it stops because there is not one script in this country of how to make yourself happy that I think that's sort of disingenuous as I do that. The only way to make yourself happy is to do that what that's not what people are trying to do what people are trying to do is be successful and I don't think they necessarily equate success with happiness. What would they do you equate success with his in alleviation of debt and leave a sheet of problems and Levy ation of a lot of the issues that people face hurting and they think of that as if you look at the problems that you have when you're growing up, but you will get a prize special if you grow up in a poor family one of the main problems that you face is you worried about paying your bills. So you say someday I'm going to get to a point with that is no longer an issue. I'm going to make it. Going to be successful. They they're not doing it thinking this is going to make me happy very rarely see that and which is one of the reasons why people even people's parents and it freaks me the fuck out will tell them to not pursue their dreams, but instead to pursue something that's more likely to happen. Like junk don't pursue your dream of becoming an actor or a singer or whatever. It is instead pursue your dream of being the foreman of the company you work at because that's attainable. You're totally right and I doubt it. But there's a lot of evidence that the financial anxiety is a message with depression and anxiety. Obviously, that is an interesting study that found people have an income from property up 10 times less likely to develop an anxiety disorder.

The people that died and I was really interesting experiment and how we can respond to the ice. When the President Obama said lay in his time. He thinks would have to happen across the country in the next 20 years to various reasons except in Canada in the seventies the Canadian government. Shows of town at random 62 genuine even random is tackled by fan. It's a marijuana news Congress about 4 hours out of Winnipeg and they said such a big group of people in this town. We going to give you guys for the net for the foreseeable future. I'm going to give all of you a guaranteed basic income. We're going to give you the equivalent of in today's money 15000 US dollars, right? There's nothing you can do. That means we'll take it away from you. And there's nothing you have to do in return for it would just be a citizen of a country want you to have a good life, right? It's probably cuz I had to cut a welfare system, but it was a lot of people falling through the cracks. They wanted to do a little experiment Z with the sweat better by Wednesday at 7:40 at interesting things happened people spend more time with that kids birthday people quit work. A lot of people turned down city jobs. So improved with better standards and the me the most interesting thing is that was a huge. Depression anxiety depression and anxiety That was supposed to be a people have to be hospitalized fell by 9% which is a remarkable in just three years. And then the program ended don't have to worry so much about the cow said anything that has depression that I should include pills, but we'll see you at the bus driver. My mom went to the shelter. My grandmother clean toilets Financial anxiety is a message driver of the de Spanish. I mean more than half of all Americans have not because of the incredible Financial pressure. They've been put under $500 set aside for crisis comes along right? So you took it about that's a huge run again. That's pretty Punk. Sometimes people just making you depressed and anxious to tell you you just got chemical imbalance in your brain, right? What do doctors still say that? What time are my nephews best friend just literally couple of weeks ago. I went to the doctor. I was told ya balance migrated in the twenty years since I was constantly by people who have been told they could come back like that told they keep talking about this is not cry hard day just as likely to prescribe antidepressants in English as they are American American still exceptionally High still. So there's that narrative that an antidepressant must be in some sort of a pill form and that they have even the expression antidepressant and antidepressant. It's a very confusing thing that we've sort of adopted very quickly in this country and its relatively recent, you know over the last sixty seventy years and the people that have antidepressants in their body that take them all the time and swear by them boy. If you try to tell them in any way that there's a better option they get extremely defensive. I have friend. She's very smart. She's she's one of the one of the people that will you know, very aggressively debate this idea that it's anything but a chemical depression chemical imbalance and I'll bet she doesn't think everybody she's not done Exercise all the time. You know, she's slightly overweight. She doesn't eat the best foods, you know, it's it's a weird thing and she's living in a society and culture that has all these forces that are Rising S feel terrible right now action as well. I would say I would expand the menu of options. I do want to take anything off the table right? It's not about you say that and I and I think you're probably being pretty honest, but you really do want to you want to eliminate Mount menu with but just by the standard of improvement you do probably want to take most people off of antidepressants. Don't you want you rather? They have a avatar the noun Choice between analogy obesity's messenger isn't in the Western World. It has a reason cuz people suddenly became greedy and lazy it's reason because our food system is terrible the way please play system is terrible. I would build cities that people come walking bicycle around right now and they're really stressed all the time. They get home from work exhausted. So they got talent acts as a lot of them and not contact some people will do what's a good stomach stapling liposuction that kind of thing right now. I'm not a gangster. But if we change the society in the way that I want to with obesity so that people could walk and cycle and you know, they had access to healthy food people would need stomach stapling would like to suck right. Perfect Analogy, but I'd say what I want to happen happen if we follow the places that succeeded in reducing depression anxiety Vuitton, you would see fewer people feeling and I need it. Chemical antidepressant it with a couple of things for us, but I don't think it's access to healthy food. I think most people have access to healthy food. They choose not to eat it they choose to Refined carbohydrates high sugar foods fast food. Those are things that are getting people fat and I don't I don't think that salad is so outside of the reach of the normal person. I just don't agree with that. I just think they make unhealthy choices. That's much more light and then get addicted the people make rosin carbohydrates. Just so you know. What are my relatives history of the way, you know, she's constantly fucking stressed because she's trying to hold together so much and one of the few release and pleasure. She has is to eat too much, right and to eat pretty shity food. Right? I'm not critical if half of that I want is to help I change her life and change the society in which we live. So she's not got back constant stress during a relationship and you treated once my tattoo guy gave everything that you know about addiction is wrong. I wish up for some grateful. Thank you. And which is based on my previous Polytech in for my previous but chasing the scream which is about addiction and I think about what you're saying relations.

Contacts, so we have to love addiction to my family and you know my mind about this and I think it really relates to what you're saying about food is most people think addiction addiction to heroin addiction right to me. Story for a really long time. You know if you took it for you kidnap someone off the street. We injected injected them with Heroin every day for 20 days at the end of that. They kept his desperate physical hunger for the chemical hooks in heroin that body would desperately need it. And that's that's why they would you be addicted right? Testicle lets me find something not right about that has explained to me Britain. If you get hit by truck can get a break your head when you take him to hospital you'll be given rights of a drug court diamorphine Right For The Pain by morphine is heroin. It's much better than Street hiring is medically peel right if anyone listening to us as a British grandmother who had a hip replacement operation. Your grandmother is taking Alli harman-wright. What we've been told about the chemical hooks is right. What should be happening to all these people in hospital loads of them should be becoming addicted doesn't happen in Britain with with people have died more thing just like understand it when I went to the bank this incredible Professor that could bring socks and I did this experiment is changed everything. I think it's very relevant to what you say about food. So this Theory the chemical addiction comes from a series of experiments that would describe very simple. You take a wrap you put in a cage and you give it to water bottles one is just water. The other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do not the right with almost always provide the drug water and almost died quite quickly. Robin Thicke is a week so that you guys You put the wrong alone in an empty cage with nothing to do except use these drugs what would happen if we did this differently, so he built a cage the equal right park or just basically like having four rights, right? They can go as a friend so I can talk all the time. They got a grain they like and colored balls and they bite the water bottles the normal water in the truck border but fascinating things in Rat Park that I like the drug water that much none of them used it cut some of that he's at but none of the music compulsively and none of them have overdosed someone that deprived of the things that make life meaningful. They tied up sensibly to the truck when they go into things that might like meaningful for rats diction is connection. How do you can see similar principle playing out with food right across the Sun margins the individual that want to say that we're not entirely away from this woman these these people that were on this diamorphine. So why you saying that they don't get addicted to it because I got to the example that happened at the same time is Rite park, right? Why are their lives particularly meaningful and Skip to like the lies were talking about here. Cuz I think you can see in an example of a good example of the Vietnam War right American troops in Vietnam about 40% used tire. And if you look at the report from the time they were shooting themselves cuz I would like Michael when the war ends we going to have all these heroin addicts on the streets of the United States. They going to come by Monday because they believe the chemical takes lyric to really good study in The Archives of General Psychiatry by professedly Robbins, the follow these guys have a select group of them. I want it found was at 95% and then just stops right coming to some catastrophic withdrawals are some physical discomfort, but they didn't you know that you're taken over by the chemical that makes no sense. But they've been exposed to old same chemical x is any homeless Street straight addicted specific on the strings now? Pestilential jungle we could die any more night to kill people you would definitely survive longer than me, but we're both find heroin a lot more appealing than we do now, right and then we come back to all night. So we have meaning and purpose we would be fun heroin addiction is not wanting to be present in your life because your life is too painful a place to be something an intervention happens. It reduces the amount of pain in your life. You could you could be less addicted is very challenging like Marianne Faithfull, you know the British Rock so I just want to stop you right there. So is there is a giant issue though with people taking pain pills after operations that weren't on pain pills before and then they get addicted to them or is it because there is an absolute real chemical look like I have a good friend who had his nose broken and they fixed his nose and he got on some I think was Oxycontin afterwards. They prescribed to him and then four months later. He's taking it every day all day. It shall we know how much they also need this experiment to measure this. So we lost people would have taken some people listen to this will be taking part in this experiment. Now when nicotine patches were invented in the late eighties, maybe come up to the early nineties huge wife of optimism, right? Cuz the chemical hook in cigarettes is nicotine nicotine patches give you the chemical hook to addicted to and so there was this huge way to get people to Camp because it's addiction is caused by chemical headaches willing to give them the chemical hook. They'll start wanting these filthy smoke so I can going to end right if that will happen is 17% of people according to the US surgeon general's report when they take Nick to music scene patches on the motet to stop smoking right speakers lights that can separate estimate of cigarettes is incredibly satisfying you take a hit you get it right in your system and boy You get that nicotine transdermal. It's very slow. It's not the same feeling. Yeah, there were experiments that show their displeasure that comes from the delivery method pesos about self-soothing is bad anxiety can't stop boredom and relate to the opioid crisis. So 1 and 130 up your prescriptions resulting in addiction, right? Just a small number by number. Reported in the places that the most affected by this by this light came in their house shove one in 130 of these has become addicted to it. That's it. Yeah, I can send you the study. That's the best buddies and that's in the United States or in person. So, you know, the one thinks it's pretty important to understand about that is the context in which this is happening right in Britain in the iTunes. Turn TV lights to Alright by lost connection. About depression as well as in chasing screen about addiction in Britain in the 18th century. There was this thing that happened to Gin craze, right? So as a people are driven out of the countryside into this disgusting Urban slums where you know that living in this world were they lost everything that made like meaningful to them? Right? And what happened was an outbreak of mass, alcoholism huge outbreaks go to the gym crazy famous paintings of like a woman drinking a bottle of gin will have baby. Window that kind of thing, right but it really happened at the time what people said is look at this evil drug Jen look at what it's done to people. If only we could get rid of these evil people selling this evil drug. Gin. This problem will go away. Now when we look back at it, we know that, because the gym because we could buy that gin in these glasses. Now anyone in Britain can go about Jan any point pretty much and it turned it off and we don't have to come and steal some alcoholism. That is the key factor this playing out here with opioids. Right? So the only fight to chemical hoax or real but I'm a virgin, absolutely adamant that you know, he he become medically addictive Xanax and pool chemical hooks to take me to Main Event in a college athlete right. 21 is in terrible car accident and they get it and they gave him meds at 10. You can be a college athlete anymore his whole life of the bill of right thing and I flee because it was in Jersey, not play anymore and I supposed to think it might be around that long to people about depression anxiety addiction to the biological explanation weather is the chemical imbalance Theory the chemical hooks Theory as that Puffs out stigma was to me you should be stigmatized in any fucking circumstance whether it's cuz you're in pain psychological pain physical pain, and did you see the point I make is I did one of the reasons why I was so committed to these Even a good way out of Sigmar can explain she have to run Springsteen evidence about that. But did you see the point? I'm making I do see the point that you making that people with lives that are unsatisfying or unfulfilling or there's some sort of a major issue in there like the athlete that's no longer going to be able to be an athlete that that's going to make these drugs more enticing I but I know too many people that have had like real issues getting off of them like physical issues with the station for withdrawals coast and most people I mean you were talking about the same people that have a hard time not eating shittyfood right people that have a hard time getting disciplined enough to go to the gym. These are the same kind of people were talking about they're going to have a massive problem. If you give them pills and those pills create a chemical look even if it's a chemical hook that you or I or a disciplined person would be able to get like, dr. Carl Hart famouse called it. He said it's like getting over the flu because that's what heroines like everyone wants to pretend. Diagnose know you feel like shit for a little while and then you're fine because it's not the thing that everybody makes it out to be withdrawals are not the thing that everybody makes it out to be but but if you have the average person and you give them pills and those pills can keep them from getting the flu. They got to keep taking those pills and if they stop taking those pills they get the flu people are Comfort jumping junkies and I think it's that's too simplistic. I think of something happen. So I think. Too hot is Terry's friend of mine is totally right, but that the physical withdrawal is a flu is not a nice thing but it's not the most dangerous thing in the thing is really devastating is the resumption at the pain that you were in Easton psychological pain that you were nice the ties in with the drug right where I don't understand why people are taking so many painkillers. We do understand why they're in so much pain. I'm not come sponsored annoying causes depression and anxiety. Right by lost connections and then the kind of 7 solutions to this problem by offer. So that's about right. I told you I was talking about he's you know, who has to be, has very little of meaning in his life is his life is just flipping through his fingers. He took oxy for quite a long time because my book and my tattoo. I think he was telling the story about addiction right? But the truth is when he took oxy he was numbed it made him is known as the work itself and then when she stopped he was a kid be depressed about like shit so I can the challenges. If you are coming off of this drug into a society of profoundly lonely and isolated people were financially insecure. You've been told that life is about money and Status who you know about screaming at each other through screens on HP, baby individual Witnesses. Of course, we all have flaws every human being has flowers, but I think it's much more because the family has risen so much tells you that it's response to social changes, right? Just want to talk to a base. It is written so much houses cost individual agency. I don't want to offend someone has anyone that all things individuals can do not talk about them in Lost connections by the fact that it's a social transformation does tell you something is it a good illustration of this kind of weird thing. It was discovered about depression in the 70s. That was so inconvenient that psychiatrist come try to brush it under the carpet in the seventies the American Psychiatric Association for the first time. What is a standardized how depression is diagnosed across the u.s. Is up to them doctors were just using their own judgment about what it even was, right? So they draw up a list of 10 symptoms, obvious things like feeling worthless crying a lot and you can guess where they were and a couple in a couple of months. Because if we just use this checklist, we should be diagnosing every grieving person is mentally ill because these are the symptoms of grief right everyone when you lose someone quotes crying fit, you know how your sister Venus a sadness that kind of thing. So I would we do to the psychiatrist regrouped and they were like a will create something at school degrees exception basically said use this checklist to diagnose depression unless the person has lost someone they love in the last year in which case none of this counts as they start using that as an excuse to follow because I like being told to tell our patients the depression is just a brain disease that you can just identify from a checklist unless that's one situation in life where it's legitimate question. What is the things in your life if you made homeless why not? He's stuck in a y know if you're really lonely the minute you admit will that you have to admit contacts and I was so inconvenient. They just over to the Greek. That's just a fascinating fact, and that seems to be a huge issue. That seems to be one of the primary reasons why people today mean if you if you stop and ask the average person today, who's not feeling well, I guarantee you they're going to be able to come up with at least one or two of those things on the list. Tell her that are factors that led right and is there it's a job of financial stress relationship stress loneliness friendship issues or death in the family or losing someone they love the fact that losing someone Alot Like a Google account that that that's one thing I see you tour is amazing person. She lost her baby and childbirth is baby is cold Cheyenne and she became an expert on this and she said she said she put it to me.

We don't grief isn't a pathology 30% of grieving parents are diagnosed and drugged in the first 48 hours after a child dies. This is a sickness right grief is not a pathology we grieve because we love someone right? It's not malfunction is no sign of Madness. It's a sign that you love the person. The way I go doing what she says now, but you know. I think one of the take the start of the depression and grief have the same symptoms as really significant because I think depression is grief feel low life not going to have a shit right? It's Greek for your own needs not being met and I when someone we love dies we can do is how the survivors and love them right but with but with with your I need something something something you could bring it on the show about psychedelic some of the research about how we might think about the mid-sixties lights of research was done giving LSD to people with depression alcohol is inverse problems. They want done to the status. We want to do scientific his promise, but they found really promising results and then take some shots the whole thing down right in the lost six years has been a huge Reawakening. It's I want an interview for lost connections two teams that worked on this in here in La at UCLA NYU Baltimore in London at UCL in South Paulo and in Norway and loads of personal things in Fahrenheit is 190 relates to our conversation powerfully and other things but I took that one I'm going to have one of the studies that I became obsessed with they did this research Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. So the leading scientist in the world and where they get shot. Simon the active component in magic mushrooms to Chronic long-time smokers who tried everything to stop smoking ad not succeeded right by my phone by my mother-in-law because my mother is it Chainsmokers somebody graffam and high when I'm 6 months while she's breastfeeding they smoking rest in the ashtray on my stomach and skin typical baby. I needed a cigarette smoke is -3 doses of psilocybin over think it was 6 months is 6 months and still remain not smoking more than she is late compared to 17% nicotine patches and they were like what's going on? About it the way we were misleadingly told about antidepressants chemical in your brain chemical process happens in the brain, but I think the most important thing and then when you suck Alexis wow is sup finding so most people will have a kind of spiritual experience. Right? Some people have a super intense spiritual experience and a minority will have no spiritual experience. It turns out the positive effects like a reduction in depression addiction correlate with intensity the spiritual experience. So you have no lease purchase Prince you don't have but doesn't is dose-dependent but I see that's pretty significant. It's a very important fact that so across the three you were giving it three times and you always given three different sizes. Do you have a more intimate most people how much more intense experience with the most? But the key thing I think about that that finding is the expense put it to me to learning experience gives you an experience what it can feel like to be deeply connected to feel deeply connected to the people around you to the natural world credible strong at night run to the person who took that you won't have you had sex since parents died when I was a teenager. I never had cuz you know, I would guess I'm getting that from the way you're describing that I sent you tell me what it is is a dissolving of the ego. That's a factor that almost everybody reports. It also releases you from deeply ingrained patterns of behavior and thinking then and highlights them so As much as it is a spiritual experience. It's also a dissolving of the self and the the way we Define ourselves is oftentimes very limiting you have this this is the way I described it. And this is the way I described very powerful psychedelic experiences. It's like the old windows think ctrl-alt-delete. That's how you reboot.

You can either start fresh and try to re-examine the world with fresh eyes or what's more convenient as you slowly slip into the mild bulshit folder and start opening it up and repeating patterns and lighting that cigarette up when you really shouldn't have in that drink when you probably shouldn't do that either and those things are common because it's comforting it's comforting for people to repeat patterns of their familiar with these scientific evidence. UCLA University College London Professor David not to do this research that shows one of things that happens in your brain. When you take psychedelics the part of the brain that relates to eat go just doesn't function at right and I'm getting one of us meeting excuse. I did was a Geico Mark he was in one of the studies in Baltimore is a very shy Reserve shutdown guy when he was 10 his daughter died and no one had told him about his dad's death is mother was just totally devastated and I would have told him about it. I need boys Converse shut down and it tasted so excited and you have to really intense experience where he he thinks he's in space. Anybody did not his father and his father. Apologize for leaving him in the knee and he reached into marketing pulled out these rules and he said I want to thank these wolves they protected my son. They've done a good job that you can let them go now and after that look really changed how we lived there a meditation and I think I think you're absolutely right.

Carlos Mexican do is West Point a direction on a compass right but there's another aspect damaged in that which I think is one of the slight differences between us what you're saying. So in the London later this receptor chronically depressed people and Robin carhart-harris about that study said to me and others one woman critically depressed. She takes the psilocybin she gets everything you're saying the definition of ego the whole thing took him out and then she goes back to her job in a shity Seaside Town what you just caught live compatible with those insights.

I'm tempted to have no email change, but people have such a small modular change the top margin will not carry them out of depression or anxiety addiction and that's why we need the widest World Health Organization says you need social Solutions as well as individual Solutions went to change the way the society Works in all sorts of ways that reduce the things that are causing this pain in the face changing the way Society works. There was a grand in Entangled gigantic undertaking. Where is changing? Your own life is not changing. Your own life is difficult.

She's not allowed to start making this might sound strange in some ways. I think changing the society is easier than isolated individuals changing the psychic healing sounds Possible body shop on Gary right if I think about the incredible transformation I've seen in my life. I tell the story lost connections about my friend Andrew Sullivan write 1994. Andre was diagnosed HIV his first or was I deserve this. I've been raised in such a homophobic world. If you know what I deserve to have this this illness is going to kill me around it was about to die since before protease Inhibitors and he goes to Provincetown Middletown in Cape Cod to do what he thought the last thing he would ever do write a book about crazy Utopia. Did he feel this is never going to happen and I'm never going to live to see this but maybe generations for now. That's what happened was the first book ever argument the gay marriage, right? Ok goes a good news 25 years from now you going to be alive but that's not good news the Supreme Court of the United States going to quote this book in the ruling making it matter. All states in the United States to introduce gay marriage and the next day you'll be invited to the White House which we lit up in the colors of the rainbow flag to celebrate with the president. And by the way. President is going to be black right? I wish I look ridiculous science fiction people 50 years ago, you know going to change the society. That's way too hard when you can do is focus on changing yourself actually gay people be really miserable if that's what they done right if that's how it was. My life would be immeasurably was it gay people have just said, you know what we sow how to change society. Let's change ourselves. We would have remained trapped and shit. See if old institutions of systems that kept his down. I actually think if I think about most the people I know who were depressed to be honest that individual change is limited but banding together that module but change is shoot right to think about which about Universal basic income. For example, right? We're getting we're going to another subject. Trying to stop with one. It's far easier to explain to one person one life why it's wrong to be homophobic that it is to change all the rednecks and all the ignorant people who don't read and all the people have deeply ingrained archaic religious ideas about homosexuality. It's far easier to educate and Luminate one person and it also can be done with the aid of psychedelics, especially MDMA therapy this one of the things that Maps is doing right now with MDMA therapy and they're they're involved in a bunch of clinical trials right now to helping people with all sorts of traumatic stress experiences soldiers people experience physical violence, all these people that are it's helping them alleviate a lot of the problems in our life. There is patterns that people are that they have in their mind that they can release show that you can release and you can be educated and you can understand you can change and grow as an individual. It's far easier to do that with One person for one person to change your life then it changed the entire culture. I do agree that there have been great strides in this country when it comes to discrimination when it comes to racism when it comes to so many different ideas. I think that's connected to the exchange of ideas that we're experiencing now because of the internet I think because of the fact that there's so many different arguments back and forth and there's so many different ways to approach things that people are being forced to change their opinions even more religious people today or more open to homosexuality than they have been in the past. I really believe that is a factor of all the information that's available and the other than the amount of communication amount of gay people to people know what's not run television from news programs from all these different talk shows where they they get a different sense of what you know to see Ellen Everyday Will gay people can't be evil Alex. So nice, you know, that means there's a lot of that. The first thing you said is it is too simplistic side the division between Boston Point United turn down the money, but why do you say that is easy to society Washington, but they're so I think we're splitting hairs here because I think if obviously if you change every individual you change the side, but it's far easier to change one person under the chain 350 Million by changing one person that you changed that one person is by Binding Together in a great price of gay people for example would be a good example, but there many many Russian anxiety and most mental help with mental problems with ratios batteries the spinal jacuzzi switch. What about your jeans for example can make you more sensitive to these things that psychological What is which of the things you want to argue about which I'm very real and important and social causes so that you know, the other things we talked about and I think it away you don't need to play them off against each other that well real. I'm so I started to get a saying we should deal with the psychological Factor 9 say we should do with the social facts about we should certainly yes. Yeah. Yeah, but I think that the idea that the Salt Lick think of what you're saying in terms of people living unfulfilled lives living in job or working in jobs that they don't enjoy where they're being controlled by a boss. It's far easier for one person to choose to change the path of their life than to try to restructure society would that doesn't exist anymore. I just CEOs like this is what it is intended. There's a meta mean it's obviously that was a huge factor in 2016 election was one of the things we talked about Is wealth inequality. Will there's no greater version of wealth inequality. Then the difference between the CEO of a massive company and its lowest worker. I mean it literally is like a king and a peasant it's a very strange sort of a structure that very recently has if it's gas. But it's so common. I mean it is it's ingrained mean how many corporations are there that operate like that top down weed. It's it's gigantic and to change that I think would be far more difficult than to change an individual's path. And to tell this one person. Hey, man, what do you really want to do? Do you would you really like making pottery with a you should try to make pottery for a living because this working for Dow chemicals that you're not going to ever feel fulfilled. You're always going to have that same anxiety on Sunday night before you go to bed. You was going to feel like shit while you're at work. You're always going to be numb you're going to be probably listen to the podcast like this while you're working just to try to pass the time. I think you're right. If you can do it or change a hundred percent my device used to be able to do it eventually you might not be able to do it right now. But if you plan for it, why wouldn't you be able to do it? I think about one of my closest relatives right? She's she's Are depressed she's got two young kids. She's working really hard. She's in a shity town. She has birth control work expertly try to think of the Majin to change so I can help us at a time in her life. Right? And I really struggled. I mean it's add environment when most people are depressed. Most people are obese. Yeah. Yep. I mean it could have just as he's right make sure spent a lot of time in the US has more people with this form in the US now, that's a very anyone who has any motion of change a 33 lost connections to seven ways. You can change your life that the science that shows will reduce depression and anxiety very likely right. I think I need to scream returns is I think you were more youth you think more could be done by individual alone in the night. They probably and I would say that's not in the sense that I would say the most powerful individual empowering thing you can do is buying together with other people like you and fight for something better. Try work together towards improving yourself community in making some sort of a bond is one of the places where so much I've walked by while engine the scientist ready fell into place with me and it was weather isolated people came together and we're not going to take this anymore. I put something but I can spend it's a long story, but if you don't sell that well, but the debts, I think you're right that she was saying, you know, what do you like to do when you said put a reason example, that's a good example, but I will say and maybe that what you like to do and actually cuz we're social species. This is what makes you like to do is get together with the people around you. Yes, I'm fight for something better. And I think it's about how this Play Down in the Dynamics around the election.

I remember it really haunted me. I was with some people who were doing some get-out-the-vote work in Cleveland and Cleveland minutes light Detroit without the Poetry of the ruins right minutes talking and we run this street in an area code Slavic city has most Lubbock right now. Let's just do two at a t-shirt at one of my shows that I put them into going to the Cleveland or death their fucking serious about Cleveland. They have the heavyweight champion of the world Steve Bay miocic chick he lives in Cleveland. This street is one of those recycling of Representative of all of your choice. It's just about the street that there was this. We're going down the street after the house has been demolished that were abandoned. I said still have people living in them. Some of them behind the tree behind barbed wire. Right sounds like a children's math problem 15 people live in this place. And then I do heroin 50 Cent Window and it was a woman looking at her what I guess was 6 day, right? She was actually the same age as me. I was 37 of the time it is and she was walking angry raging. And she made this verbal slip this really stay with me. I thought about it. Why you speaking at it? The area used to be like their parents and grandparents, right? And she meant to say when I was young when she actually said is when I was alive she has died and it made me think about this is how the researchers think about you were saying this relates to the individual vs. Collective debate that we have been touching on Native American groups in Canada. Did they come to Fascinations grapes have really high suicide rates right on this special right to 80% increase in Canada. Some of them are pretty high suicide and some have none right now. Why is that? So you spent 10 years researching this discovered lots of things one piece. He discovered was Some of these groups have basic been able to fight to regain control of that Community, right? They rebuilt that language they rebuilt that school control the schools and you know, whether and some have just been so down that I have been able to do that with an out-of-control they were able to regain over the community come out of meaning that you find in your life. Meaning is to having a story about who you are. It's about having social connections around you soon. Learn your part of something bigger than your side. What do you like to do? I buy me a nice lady. Because we're such a fraction Society because we find it so difficult to be present with each other right that the constant distraction of refracting everything through screens, which makes it feel like she could talk about some of that if you want. The actually that initial step is quite hard because we so broken up Ryan. It's not just the initial step. It's you've gone too far and One Direction likes a look at it this way if we all started this neutral point, right and someone like Jamie does what he wants to do and and finds a good path and starts going in that direction and keeps improving his life and then eventually is a happy human being as an adult or you have someone to go to the wrong way. They they get addicted to food and cigarettes and drugs and antidepressants and they get into bad relationships and then they have children that they have to take care of it and they have a job at the hay and then they find themselves at 37 years old looking like they're 65 trying to figure out how to get back. We'll they've got to find a way to not just move ahead but to get back to that neutral point cuz they have to go back in time over all the shit. They fucked up and have walked far longer path. So it's Possible path but it's a far along a path if you all had everyone's going in a direction and that directions 25 miles away. But you go 37 miles backwards. You have to go to set 37-mile forward and then the additional 25 miles. That's the problem with people. They look at the the the daunting nature of that task and it's very intimidating to them and they don't feel like I can make it if they don't feel like they can but there is satisfaction and hope and happiness and moving towards a positive direction and that's what people have to realize. It's not about a goal. It's about the journey being a positive journey in the feeling that you get of improving your life incrementally on a daily basis and it's also the mindset that you carry with you on that Journey. You can't look at yourself and go God why am I not successful yet? Why am I not rich? Why am I not this? Why am I not that you have to say? I am better than I Was yesterday tomorrow I will be better than I am today and I'm on the right path and there is a lot of deep satisfaction and happiness and being on the right path. Now, you're a person who wants to be an author but instead you're an accountant every day. You spend not feeding that idea that you can be an author is going to chew away at you was going to chip away at you and it's going to move you away from that neutral point many many miles. I totally agree and I think that the that thing about when people realize they have agency that's one of my guys especially if you want spending know how was your day been controlled one of the things you do to get through that is that process of internal deadening paint store and I'll call in later oxy he would just one of them himself, right Ryan cuz there's an entitled Edna you have to do to get through that which is why I think one of the key aspects I took my discretion is this transformation what get the thing that makes people dream most of the time he's making 87% of Buzz don't like it at the best you go to go to the hall of that right and change people to sell that bike store in Baltimore. They were working class people, you know, who owns they stop a democratic Cooperative right date that they transform the lives that they were good example. Pigs have a relatively limited margin. They were low wage workers in a in a in a low-wage industry who made this transition. So I'm sending the people called make these transitions Brian even in difficult circumstances that I absolutely can. I just think yeah, I think I'll think about the The Farmer in the field in Cambodia, right? He's nice and off and he's in this field and it's a guinea pig need to change his life, but he also needed someone to buy him a cow, right? 
========,9,title.
He couldn't afford that kind on his own and that's a choice. Yeah. Yeah right by isolated cage the rock called leave the cage where you could make it. I do it just to individual Coil Tubing. I think some people attribute this just to just to individual to individual failing when I think that the Can play alongside other component? I don't think of it that way at all. I think that I think of it as poor choices. I don't think of it as individual fan. I've made many many poor choices in my life. Here is one of the big ones you tell people because there's a lot of people that are listening in this at various stages of her life. If you're young and you have an open Future you don't have massive obligations and Dad and all the all the different things have become a real hindrance as you get older move towards a direction that is attractive to you. Do not move towards the direction that is safe don't do it. Cuz if you do do that if you just take that same job and then there's a lot of people won't know more people can do that. That is a bullshit stupid way to think that will fuck you. That way to think will fuck you. You can do what you do what you choose to do. You can get better at things if what you choose to do. You can move forward and try to figure out a way to carve a path through that life and it's not going to be easy but nothing worth doing is easy. But this idea that will give you want to just do construction. If that's appealing to you. You would like to just be a labor and there's this look doesn't need for that and Society but doesn't bother you. It's but find out what bothers you and find out what you enjoy if you're a labor and you really want to be a songwriter. Will you better fucken chase that song writing shit you better do it? Because if you don't do what you don't want to be a 60 year old man sitting around just depressed and crying and then maybe you call your friend up who does do that for a living and in he's having a great time and he just release his new album and you both start out together in high school. And here you are at different stages of your life. And you you haven't pursued your interest. You haven't pursue your passion. You haven't pursued what you really want to do this every word. You just said, I would just lie alongside it which is and we should change our society. So few people get trapped in more people in the moment. A lot of people feel up is probably a way that. Going to start happening. Yeah, I think that can happen that can help. A lot of people are your basic needs. Your food is taken care of. I think President Obama talks about that was the end of his time partly because he said Russian torture this to him, He said it made this point in his way, but he was interviewed Wired Magazine. He said he thinks this will have to happen in the next 20 is partly because of the extraordinary disruption that's coming to the economy through United station. So, you know as well if there isn't a universal basic income under that have genuine can send to people as well, but I think you think that's really why he's he's saying that I think they make so much money about someone said, you know, if the economy's on this going to be 7 tech billionaires and everyone else employed to get the messages, right? I don't think that's something I don't know which is I think they know at some level that they don't stop providing some if if the society doesn't stop providing some baseline insecurities. I forgot to think I think three million people in the United States make a living through driving from now probably right after I can cause a likely to just that's going to be gone. All right, man with luggage cash no achievement attainments the various reasons why we should not that fool and that's devastating right? So I think you're right there a universal basic income is one of the important strategies that can that can cut it with a recurring theme in this conversation, which is Can I suppose my books to chasing the scream and Pulaski connections get it Unidad depression anxiety all over the world and just look really different places that do things really different day and then some things that just recovered but both right give me example with addiction. The place has the most registered. 
========,9,title.
It should not be in the places that I've said this isn't it? I'm not saying this but people have said this is a problem to the individual individual needs to fucking swapping selves out have I must have been growing addiction crisis from gets worse and worse the places that I went to what I said, actually this is a collective probably need to collect it solution. What are difference of Portugal for example in the year 2000 have one of the worst drug problems in the world, right? 1% of the population is addicted to heroin. It was incredible every year the problem got worse as they tried the American way more more rested more people imprisoned more people and one day the prime minister of the opposition got together and they were like that. We can't go on like this right because more people in our country been addicted to heroin. Guapo's thing they stop a panel left on Amazing Mountain Goats No adults allowed and they said they have you recommend, right? So I got to be like if Trump and Chuck Schumer Nancy Play Sia Breathe every woman to buy buy find a on this so I can set decriminalized all drugs for cabbage to crock everything bought on. This is the crucial Next Step take all the money. We currently spend on fucking people's lives up on arresting them shaming them stigmatizing imprisoning them and spend it instead of timing that lives around they stop micro loans for people with addiction problems could stop and run small businesses about things that I cared about. They stop a big part of a subsidized work. So you know that you used to be a mechanic if I go to a garage they said you would play this guy for ye will pay her. Is white jeans, right the results support Flippin Incredible Crew the best scientific study of a criminology injecting drug, you spell by more than 50% stats about HIV 1-6 was so striking that we started chasing. The scream is with them. And right. He said this is fucking Madness. We're going to have a massive explosion and druggies. It's given to him and he said to me Everything I said what happened didn't happen and everything the other sites of what happened did and it talks about how we thought we'd ashamed to eat spent 20 years before the decriminalization fucking people's lives up that goes to the debate that we took him out because that was Nebraska individuals changing, right? That's that's very clean individual changing making better choices, but that make you look better choices in a context context for the society instead of beating them down is trying to lift them up. Just want to make it's a very good point. It's a very important point in what Portugal is done should be studied by our country, which is now falling right back into the old Nancy Reagan just say no bulshit days with Jeff sessions at the helm of a terrifying person in that regard cuz he's so ignorant as to what's going on is so ignorant still calling marijuana gateway drug. He's a fool me really has ended the the pattern is terrifying because they're trying to call Kratom an opiate right now there there's there's all sorts of resistance to what we know of a safe alternatives to pharmaceutical medication. Like CBD that's another one there demonizing they want to categorize that with heroin and cocaine. It's fucking terrifying. It's it's it's a very very weird time because there's so much evidence and so much science and so much history when it comes to things like Portugal where it's been successful to decriminalize everything and spend the money on treatment programs, but they're ignoring that they're ignoring that because it's convenient to survive but my concern is it's not disgusting and it's saying what you saying is it's not even outside, you know, when it comes to the the the opioid crisis. I think I've been talked about this in quite quite the wrong way. So it made me realize that she had deep is Nancy Reagan script is in the coach of the even liberals my side of politics if I sit even say that story about this is basically Eagle drug dealers came along they gave people these drugs. They accidentally put in this case the eagle drug dealers of the big Pharma hooked and that's why we have this crisis right now. They have My Confession has a lot more about I'm very critical of them. But that story is just ridiculously simple antidepressant prescriptions across the United States that were true. 
========,9,title.
It would not make sense. Not the opioid prescriptions are also concentrated concentrated in the places. Where is suicide forest what depression is highest where some everywhere but there's a reason for that describe the IP addresses to spare. That's right. I said, I know you keep the country when I go to places that have been most affected by the opioid crisis. Dead devastating one Marianne Faithfull. He was Mick Jagger specimen to be Mick Jagger's girlfriend. The car pisses me off that she wants shutdown Jamie and very challenging line in her and she said something like heroin saved my life. Cuz if it wasn't the heroin, I would have killed myself right and got me some some I'm saying is no good solution to despair if we want it clearly. Very obvious reasons if we want to understand why the spinach and cream cheese, we have to understand these things. I'm worried about getting a job is insane way, right? You know, it's just we need to crack down on the Mexicans and I'll stop in dollars. The War on Drugs. It's got it for a hundred years. It's imprisoned more people than any other country in human history and at the end of all that you guys can't even keep drugs out of your presence. Will you pay people to go around the fucking perimeter to the whole time? So good luck keeping them out of the country with to 3012 old is That's so ridiculous and soap said that it's not just that it's why would you think that you could tell a grown adult with a showing and can't do with a really simple? I'm pretty sure that's pretty much what will be the more Liberal Liberal liberals. But the more liberal argument with Chase this simplistic even Bernie Sanders while off I would have bought it for I think he's got this wrong which is the I think there was some of the deeper problems as well clearly about did the story that it's about the drug companies would go to look at the one place that sells annoyed by some other place so, Switzerland, Fixing to my dad's phone that was pretty Shelby slate. Tristan Thomas Attorney problem in the nineties right huge almost as you know quite as bad as what's happening right. Say but it was massive and Switzerland amazing. Kick-Ass female president. Curry's Dreyfus explains people. Look when you hear the word legalization what you pictures Anarchy and Chaos, right? What we have now is anarchy and Chaos when you prohibit drugs what you guys unknown criminals selling unknown chemicals to unknown drug users on the dock Builders Bartlett's disease and Chaos. Will she proposed to legalize heroin? Right doesn't mean there's like a heroine Island to CVS in in Switzerland, right? So different things can be legalized differently. I don't know the rules in LA, but I'm pretty sure you could legally if you wanted to own a dog a monkey and a lion. I'm pretty sure the rules are different right? I don't think you could get him in, Texas. Text us so you could buy the alcohol is legal to the way it works is hiring from the Switzerland your sign to a clinic. I went to the one in Geneva where the former president now lives across the street just tells you something and you got you got to go early in the morning for reasons. I'll explain you giving your heroin that you can't take out with you you going to use it that and then you leave and you go to a job cuz like they do two things and it's the exact opposite of what what's replacing Levi says stop prescribing and don't give support. Right? What does it mean switching his exact opposite and they'll give you the drug addicted to and then they give you loads of support to figure out why you're in such pain in the best place to help you get housing that you subsidize work to give you lots of therapy. Are you aware of a Boga? Yeah, Yeah, but that's probably one of the very best ways for people to quit drugs. Show me especially some horrible drug dude, and it's a ruthlessly introspective drug that many many people found great success and kicking heroin cigarettes alcoholism getting over past abuse and it is it's a long experience it can last more than 24 hours totally illegal in the United States, but a lot of people go to Mexico and do it and I have had very good friends that had problems with pills that went over there and kick them because of a Boga does that you should try to. To grab Amante's a friend of mine to save the Lost part about Switzerland. Bike Run Away surprise me in that clinic under the chief psychiatrist. They will give you a they will give you any days. You want except one that will kill you and there was never any pressure to cut back which really surprised me so you can go to this clinic and they don't you up with Heroin that you have to use it that the contact with each other while I'm so lit people selling automobile kind of badass. Is the happiness zero heroin overdose deaths on legal heroin in Switzerland in the 12 years apart on 60 has the ratio of people using to not using how's it Goin Down for any significant pulling hair? When you sleep past researchers by Professor Amber's Elkton Hagen is showing that bin know that's in the legal program in Norma Spaulding that's in the illegal program. Jesus to cut back by the time and stop right when I went. I think they would like two people have been on the park. I'm going to stop and I said to come and get your buns. I don't understand this. How is this happening to me? Like I was an idiot and she said people slaves get better unless the lights get better. They don't want to be nice that I so much goes right back to what you were saying about antidepressants and people's lives like the choice that you make in the past that you take in the people you surround within the happiness that you feel from your community. 
========,9,title.
That's ultimately what leads to a fulfilling life. And if you have all that, why would you fuck with Heroin lost connections is because it's only saying stop human beings have needs and if you need something that you don't look as nice the time I see what you said is very important than theirs psychological needs that are just as valuable and important as physical needs. Like we know we have needs her nutrients. We know it needs for water we have needs. Psychological for for all sorts of different things. Our communities are incredibly important love is incredibly important family is incredibly important, you know, I know some people that are older men that have been Bachelors their whole lives and their childless and now they're you know, they just they don't have a deep connection with anybody and they get to this very weird strange place for the like is this it now I'm 70 years old and I've never really had children and I don't know what to do. And this is this is my life now and it's they did they have all the friends of had families now and their families a lot of times the kids are grown up and it becomes very very strange. I thought about that at the University of Chicago, but he's leading expert in the world and lioness. They had this really interesting. They just said both right if you go separated from the tribe. If you were alone reason, you're about to be eaten to help you with this ring stinks Prime in the rock band. The book is a stressful is being punched in the face by a stranger when it comes to cortisol release, right? That's how deeply we are resistant to loneliness is a signal telling you to get back to the tribe is why we vote is a really important signal if you keep his haven't had that signal we wouldn't be here right when you look at these these men slated. There's a cop at this incredible protest movement happened in Berlin on a big enormous housing project. But no one knew each other and they came together to protest it was a woman who is about to kill herself about to be evicted and the whole housing project came together to say she should be allowed to stay in Ohio and they should have a rental fries and it's an amazing story. I'll tell in the book but there's something one of the women said to me the difficult to determine she grown up in turkey and she comes to driving. I think she was 17. She said when I grow up in Turkey while I cool my home was my Village and everyone in it and then I came to live in the western world and I love the way your medical home is just your four walls and if you're lucky your family and then this protest began You got to know each other and his whole place became my home and I think of everywhere. He is home now and then she realized it but we are homeless in some sense in the Western World humans have a need for a sense of belonging and a sense of how young is too small to me also to my blood but I mean, this is wonderful opposing impractical Alexander. Hey, man, who said home is where people notice when you're not there right? I don't love us like these guys and I'm not religious person. Let me know everything we talked about they have different our conversation is being to what my doctor told me when I was a teenager and I go in and I say I'm in real pain and I feel that pain is leaking out of me and I can't control it and he says, You just got malfunction in your brain, right? What are the worst things about their many things wrong with that first thing what you said to me is not true. I'm sure he believed it. I think he was missing for two me you said was to me the biggest problem with just telling this exclusively biological story about depression and anxiety this some real biological factors caused from having this conversation. Right all those people you were talking about you are so insistent as I was that depression is just the result of a chemical imbalance. If you think I disconnect you from the source of your pain, it tells you you're just biologically broken up or she will be always going to be biologically broken when the conversation we're having which is a different conversation with a difficult conversation is a nuanced conversation is not simplistic. It's not one problem 1 leave it to solve it. It's a much deeper and more textured way of thinking that is the conversation. We have to have the best scientist in the world to telling us the World Health Organization. Which has been pushed in it. Like you said that.. Break in Mexico. Driving 37 miles in the wrong direction, right? We're just driving in the wrong direction with driving away from the source of all pain rather than towards it where it can be understood and salt give you some pain in human life. But the fact that we have this one and 10 13 year old boys taking a stimulant drug to make them focused. I think the figure is 30% of old people in in retirement homes making an anti-psychotic drugs to shut the fuck up is that rebelling against the way that being treated in between wanting for middle-aged women in the United States attack at Comic-Con ticket pricing at any given time and for Somers Point strength has he been given antipsychotics in the United States is just off the scale me to Mimi is written about this. About getting something like a majority of children in foster care in the United States. I've been given stimulant drugs to shut them up. Yeah, that's that's a disturbing won the riddle in the various stimuli. They give the children. What's that about? What's the cause of that is much less than the other things we talked about. It came up a lot of the conversations that I had their many things going on here. One of them is a lot of this. Is it depression and anxiety. I wrote about I couldn't help but notice reading all the research into being a scientist also can lead to a decrease in focus and attention. So for example, if you get into work and you to control the time you have to deaden yourself to get through it, it's hard to detect attention to muscle right? It's harder to bring your brain back to focus and like Joey wanted to just going to collapse and watch you know, Watch what are the ship was on The Bachelor what I think that they would charge me whatever it is. I had to take oxy but not to go to the 11th of self-harm. Right? But they didn't strike Denver good reason. If you're on your own in the savanna in Africa, right? 
========,9,title.
Of course is this evidence that the people with the lowest levels of attention problems and depression and anxiety in the United States are the Amish, right? And I am a atheist gay liberal so that I can actually change it to me. Go to bed. I thought really humble by Gunna spending time. They went to the Village Court Elkhart LaGrange, which is just outside, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the still alive. Wrong, but you know, if your nomination you got to leave and come a little more like Old English. Well. Well, right and then you decide whether to come back about 80% to 20%. I'm out cuz we do that right now calls going to tell you to leave for two years in the disciples comebacks exact opposite. So they know I was really well and Loren Beech inflamed is an Amish guy that he said he said the things I may see to it that 70 show. He said I used to love trucks cuz I call out turis to Off the Grid. And he said but you know if I kept those things I wouldn't spend time with my family. I would spend time with my children. I would know you my neighbors were any he said he said well as you could only lose weight together as a group right helps what helps you lose weight together as a group that you would find it harder on your own. This is like Weight Watchers to the problems of Western civilization and he's like, yeah, that's why I'm saying that you go to get more idea that the solution is to have less and be present more is really challenging right? I don't I don't even think it's about having less it's about what they're doing is looking think about what the Amish are doing. First of all mass of sense of community right there very connected but not using cell phones and not using email. So the community is also based on one-to-one interaction real social cues real social in it. Which is critical it's a big part of being a human being and it's one of them are apps and things in modern society to physical labor. They're involved in a lot of physical labor because they don't use electricity. They don't use power tool that there's so many things that they don't do so because of their culture they're making their own homes, right? So they have a vested interest in helping each other working together as a community and they have a deep sense of satisfaction of constructing each other's homes. You construct my home with me. I help you build your home. They take care of their animals. They take care of their crops that take there's there's a real connection with where they get their food from a real connection with where there they live their Community the sense of Just at the whole the sense of belonging to something that's bigger than you. It's it. There's so many factors involved in their happiness that you can kind of see where yeah, there's a lot of wacky shit with the the cult aspects of being an Amish person, but what you get out of it, it's almost like if you had a self-help group that subscribe to all the positive benefits of being Amish and they just called it like regrounding or something like that or you just go out there and you've become a part of Nature and meet me. That's that seems like a co-op. It seems like some sort of a farm base Co-op write each other's houses. Stay together. You don't have to wear sexy clothes. Let's just all wear the same shit. It's no big deal. I love how you put that in that you were added to the inequality the richest as well. I think she's okay, but it's not like you're not holding them back. Stick out this relation to attention so that the stereo. Amish kids don't seem to develop ADHD, right and it's been it's been surprisingly understudied and Amish doctors test for the kids are bouncing off the walls like he's adorable. The main thing is when I spoke to them. They said yeah we go some kids you don't want to concentrate and stay in school. But so we just haven't got around to go fishing and hunting inside right? Just making it harder for us to come straight in the environment. I think the raw there's always going to be a natural variation in people you want to sit and focus on one thing compared to people you want to get a run around at it clear. You can see how is a species that benefits both. Right? Right. But what we do is we try to buy every child into one particular motive big of course is designed to prepare them for the regional schools of shity in deadening does coffee Kearney says every school has an official curriculum and a hidden curriculum. The official curriculum is like history geography whatever and the hidden curriculum. This is what we're training you to put in your life right front 87% of people don't like that and you're twice as likely to hate your job is love your job. System with the dead and children so they learn you going to fucking sit there and shut up and do what you're told right that's not a malfunction of the system. That's an unconscious function of the system. Right? So we could go to the system where we bashing these kids prepare them for this economic system is making us feel miserable to me. The solution is to change the way we work so we don't have to fucking dead nacho turn. Right, but the only shoot here, you know, do what she say, it's not like that doing. Hi and cognitive label bring it, right but the decades to them. How do you kick it goes fishing and running around normal people.

Actually, I could write you make sense in that context right depression with todas pathology. Actually. I'm actually not entirely but largely a response to things going wrong with told addiction is a pathology is a response to things happening with a basin is a pathology in some cases. It's response to things go wrong, which hold the kitchen I want to be able to fight. This is a pathology meaning they make sense. Right doesn't mean that good. Most clearly don't get to be a basic cleaning all good to be addicted will be asleep. But if you understand that totally different way. Responding to them once I actually fucking what the places that the drug Woolbright for chasing the screen and Drug War. I went out with a group of women. Prison run by that fucking psychopath Joe Arpaio. So into the age of trump pardoned, how the fuck did you pardon that guy deeply the way I felt very sorry for him. Anyway, I went out on this group with with this group of women who makes go out on a chain gang t-shirts and I was a drug addict one members of the public more Clem and Jared them, right and I'm in the car in Back to the prison with the school 10 city and the women with terrified of something carbajal which is why you were sent if you fuck top, right? An asset to the gods we take me to City Hall and I've been in a lot reporting prisons in God's always I want to show you the bad things in this one cuz it's a fucking pantomime of Cruelty. They want you to say it right to let me to the hallway it was in fact the concrete's Outback concrete Style with nothing in it. No TV nothing like she saw my face through that was just a human being it wasn't one of these Gods. She's been there for a month and I remember the old days auction on the chasing screen website and chasing the screen. Calm and I remember looking in the salad thinking This is the closest you could get to a literal human reenactment of the cages that guaranteed addiction and rights. And this is what we doing think he'll stop this woman for being addicted all the places which I purchase based on punishment and shine to watch these things. Sometimes people say punishing people with addiction problems doesn't work. That's way too soft on it. It makes the problem worse right those women fucking broken devastated than I even more broken than devastated. They cannot even more fucking big tit, right increasing one's right to me. Agencies I purchased was his problem. Based on compassion connection love understanding seeing that makes sense work on my XXX is still could be problems in anything. We do I purchase based on shame and stigma and rage and just condemning people. They just made the problem worse. Yeah, there's no doubt about that. And there's also know about. About what you were speaking about it when you started that rant about schools that about schools going to Children trying to fit them into these these very convenient categories and trying to get them to get comfortable with doing things that they don't want to do that. That's great. If we're we're resigned ourselves to Turning children into work robots that you just said that when I was in high school, I was like, there's got to be something wrong with me. I can't concentrate. I'm never going to be good at anything. I was like, I'm just going to resign myself to be an outcast. I'm going to resign myself to be a loser because I just couldn't sit still in class. I couldn't pay attention. I didn't want to do the homework. I was bored out of my fucking line and I didn't even realize there was anything that I could do that I would be intellectually curious about. I mean, I just I didn't think that that was a part of my life. I didn't think I was a curious person. It was just merely because I was being forced to do a bunch of shit that I didn't want to do it in tainted my idea of learning and when I got out of school and then when I started reading books just for my own Amusement in interest then I realized oh, I'm a very curious person. I just I just didn't want to do what they wanted me to do. I didn't want to study what they wanted me to study and I didn't want to be stuck in some room with some person who was under motivated and really didn't have any understanding of how to deal with children was the rare person one out of five when I was six teachers that would come along that would give you likes. Spark of happiness and love and you go like this class is pretty cool. That's a good teacher like all she's nice. You know how he's fun? It was rare who is very rare. Most of time. It was a dull grind and I would wake up with nightmares after I graduated that I'd fucked up and didn't get the right amount of credits and I had to go back to school. I would have crazy nightmares that I would have to repeat the 12th grade and go back to school because I just it was soul-sucking and to me it represent the future cuz the future was going to be more soul-sucking because you're going to be working 40 hours a week plus overtime doing something that you hated and this is what you had to do if you wanted to get by in this life and that is what was presented to me. That's why it's presented to a lot of people and if you take that and keep going with it, you'll eventually become that guy who was in that job and then you say well, maybe I'll get some happiness if I get a nice car and so you do you take out a lease on a nice car. And then now you have this debt they have to pay so now you have to keep working and you keep working so you can keep his car while I'm going to get Condo, and then you get a condo. You have more debt then while getting married we're getting married while we got to take out a loan for the marriage cuz it's really expensive to get married and all she wants a big wedding and then you get a big wedding and a big ring and I'll just deny your fucking deep deep in the hall. Now you have children of shit and then you know you like why I really don't want to be selling insurance anymore. I wish I could I wish I could have been an artist. I wish I could have done this. I wish I could have pursued my interest. It's kind of too late. You're a hundred fifty miles away from this the neutral point. So you got to go a hundred fifty miles back before you can start at 0. Can you put out so well, and I just think about that. This is the heart of my business connections is saying we don't have to have a human culture that deadens people write on we don't have to have a culture people are controlled dead in the isolated. That's not how most humans have ever lived the Amish live much could a human beings have lived in the lessons? We can learn from all these things that we talked about about about reconnections many types of pop what you're saying is we we live in a landscape has been constructed note to self people but to self corporations right this very unusual recent human Innovation, you know by then he's accountable to then what you decide the priority still wet place with your colleagues by voting maybe once every three months once a year whatever the boss is accountable to you. That's a very different. Play bleeding and thinking about the things we do most of the time and that would have been required for school system that prepares people to be citizens taking part in a wet place nor I you put the Brandy Library cuz you know just impossibly receiving orders that requires a big systemic change now, lots of people on making that transition United but people until it's time but Baltimore Bicycle Works, it made that transition on that. He's a big social changes we can make the report is not saying to people like it sounds to me like no one said to you the fact that he fucking hate this school is a sign that you are more likely to be successful not lights, right the things that will make you a success in your life. All the things that the school is trying to be out of you right now. I'm supposed to be out of you mentally Bi-Rite and in a sense that that's what we need to say to a lot of people about these forms of discomfort. It's not a sign of craziness. It makes perfect sense you feel this way and you Right to feel this way to wonder if that's what's causing all these children to be on adderal and all I do know all that the very stimulants they put kids on do, you know Prozac and all the different things that they do it's literally because they're trapped in this thing and I can't do it and I can't do it. I can't do it and it's just can't concentrate and so they give him something and they giving this pill in that pill turns them into a working robot and its related to the things we increasing competition for examples of parents said it in such an unequal Society if you if you have a society got no way we're take it doesn't do. Well they can have a good life. And if you really think I have a good life does less anxiety about how my kids they can have a really fucking terrible the counter that is rich kids don't do well at all. I mean that's a real problem with kids that don't have to do. Well, I think it's the secret society that drugs kids at the bottom to shop these kids in foster care. Space City make them docile. You've got kids at the top here a drug to make them compete. You know, I'm not a girlfriend is a Wall Street Banker who is Kid on on Cox Adderall a stimulant drugs when he was a young teenager cuz he said he's sick call Tracy to make them compete in an unnatural way in the fucked-up part is it works?

Well, it is worth putting at home right about the synonym of the actually The Descendants kids about tolerance to it by the time right? So I actually in ition it works really really well and then gradually how to get pirate Hideout is isn't it? Eventually they doesn't maximum limit out all day and then they will experience Withdrawal, right? Oh my god. Look what happens to my kid when I take him out of breakfast relativity how to kick in addiction and I'm in bed. I thought if I kind of diction she had a minor one of my younger brothers truss prices of the deer say that cuz he didn't she used to go to driving school in the morning. She would snort a line of coke before she went and then in the car, he got to swallow His Kind like pill and I thought what a crazy coach of the illegal I'm going to end up with have been criminally punished and his copay light substances required by the police are required by the school and mandated by the Dogs Out What culture is fucked up about how he thinks about altering itself chemically about children about connection to Prime to the capacity to understand. What was happening to this is the coolest thing we've done if you just get people he's ridiculously simple. What is ridiculous story about depression. It's just a chemical imbalance you cut them off from understanding the thing that's right in front of them. And sometimes I think we would both my books were chasing the scream and lost connections at times. I don't even need to say this is so if you're insecure you're going to be actually he does need to be sad when you say it's a very unusual positions. I'm really quite radical, but that's a weird into common sense, but it's not common is what it is. It's not a common understanding now, I want to get in To this with you. What about the criticisms of your work? And how have you have you taken it in them? If you debated anyone about your work cuz I read quite a few things online that were very critical and I didn't agree with him. I didn't agree with what they're saying, but I wanted to get your take on it as soon as the time out by psychiatrist admitted at 3:39 read the book. They were responding to an extract from the book make every point. You want to make rice like that because it's what I thought I was saying is even though I think break lady didn't say that's what I thought I was saying is it bad for everyone and people should stop taking them if I had said that it would be nice to me. That's not my position easy way to criticize you in just a pic in is in the sky. I think it's not much on average but it's not nothing some people like for someone who is trapped in a person's I think she's right you change is not experiencing extreme side effects as most people do the vast majority of people and so I think there's been some criticisms. That's a dangerous and terrible thing to do in response to that is because I didn't say that you should carry I'm taking the benefits outweigh. The side effects is it's more like an ideological misunderstanding. Who sang we live in such an individualistic culture that if someone comes along and Sweet Bay City think there's two ways of thinking about this right you your depression or anxiety prediction to teach with biological problem in which case you deserve love and support if you dismantled the iPhone service on my phone.

I lost my talking about. I don't think because I'm talking to this third category, which is biology's real psychology is real but most of the drivers at the social the in the way we live so long we've been trying to not thinking social time and I think a lot of people just literally don't get what I'm saying. Right when I was a kid Margaret Thatcher said that the time said, there's no such thing as Society. Is there any individuals in their families now? I never liked Margaret that chip has made me realize. Trying to analyze. Right. I was depressed at 13 years. Social sciences, right it never even occurred to me. That was a societal component to how bad I felt right. So I was kind of like a factor right to my own pain and distress to see what I mean. We're so individualized an internal I internalized is individualism. The I think people understand again, they were working on the extra season in the main but I think it was possible for them to be like fuck you I can't do that right now. I can see why that's saying that I'm not so I wouldn't push back on them. So they're on their emotions and this is why we need to check car accidents, right? We individual driver should drive safely, but we don't just leave car safety up to that. We have airbags and seatbelts and speed limits driving test with arrest people of the DUIs. Right if we just took away so we accept that this individual and individual roll, but this is social right the whole society deals with the problem of car accidents and what I'm saying is the whole society should deal with the problem with depression anxiety. We need social changes like the book says in what places is when we talked about law that reduce the reasons why people are so depressed and anxious in the first place, but I think in a society that so devalued the idea of the social It's amazing. We speaking fucking Swedish world. I can understand why I think they're just neglecting to consider the possibility that some of the factors are because of your life and and the social aspects the physical aspects the exercise the died at all those various things. Is it many many people that do certain neglecting to take those even into consideration. I also think people work way too much. I don't think that's the way to live your life. I think we've got a really bad system and I think the system has existed for so long that we assume that this is the only way to live that you have to do a 40-hour work week. I think it's ridiculous. I think we should work maybe four days a week and it might be three we might we maybe people would be more productive they kicked ass for 3 days a week and then had a fun time for for, you know, maybe maybe it's like one-on-one off one-on-one off one on what off maybe it's like that and just that's the way we live life. Like I have a fucking work day and have a day where you don't work. Have you choose to live more to work more because I know you're trying to pursue something and you're dedicated person. You have a job. That's one thing but I just think this soul-sucking grind of, you know, getting out of college at 21 and grinding until you're 65 and then look forward to your golden years. You're dying mother fucker. There's no golden years. That's all horseshit. You you know you watching On Golden Pond too many times. You're not going to make it known he was my daughter is nothing but cheese. What we've done is we've told people the pump out of stigma. Is to say the problem is just biological right? We said you should not be criticized because we told people you should not be judged for your depression anxiety addiction because it's possible. I'm totally agree. Obviously people should not be judged that anxiety depression addiction experiment showed that this is just a complete expense amazing neuroscientist. Call Mark Lewis Here. I am worried about the mall cuz we're in this just reintroduced stick Mariah for saying it's not just biological and he said yeah, he did anyone ever doubt but leprosy or Aids with biological problems right now without 2.0 noticed. That was some stick Morgan's leprosy nights. Why do you think saying something is biological remove the stigma? Experiment by what is pico de Aguila mats at which looked at this question sticker sheets. She wanted to figure out which is more destigmatize in telling people think mental health problems are caused by your biology or saying that caused by your life for the experiment they bring you in and they said before the experiment begins which way to sit here and fill in a questionnaire, right? This isn't you don't realize that this is actually the experiment just sitting next to someone else so you don't realize we got chatting and the answer will the run it two ways. Sometimes the actor will say, I've got a mental health problem because of my biology and sometimes he'll say I've got mental health problem because of bad things that happened to me right then you'll come through to this rain going to teach this other person cuz you don't realize is not on a computer. Testing how well people land patents and every once you told it to him every time he gets it wrong. I want to push this button and this button will get him a short shop electric shock, right if I come out but it is uncomfortable. Right and they wanted to say with a big difference in how many electric shocks and how hard you hit the button depending what you were told what they found was what significantly more. You use apps the person more and harder if you throw the problem is just you two that biology then if it was you two things that happened to the night-light slime, that's because I can't use that stuff we talking about is the part that I stayed with his what it says it always saying is there's just this close to people who are biologically different to us and they have this floor that you and I don't have you can see where that leads to Sigma actually uniquely vulnerable to this stuff actually two things. I'm making some people depressed anxious and addicted I'm making loads of us just less happy than we could be lashful filter me could be divided into two tries to sit on a Continuum and actually the fight that will help these people are depressed and anxious will also improve Yule. I want us to me a much more powerful message. It's only problem being an inexplicable biological malfunction it say Response to things that you can see in your life, right but it's interesting that we've always had the term Sadness by people have always experience sadness. But if you go back and go through ancient literature, you don't see a lot of stories about people suffering from depression. That's a relatively new distinction extreme happiness always been people living unhappy lives, but the state of being depressed as being a clinical psychological sort of a diagnosis. That's a relatively recent. What do I do that? It's a pathology. Yeah just came to the the US I never met but I met the first time someone I've often been in digestion pill. Remember just the way in digestion is a sign from your buddy. You're eating too fast. You don't want to you don't get rid of that signal you'll hurt yourself, right? But that's that's not a malfunction. That's that's a function, right? Things to feelings that we have distressed on no malfunctions that telling us something is missing in the environment in Psychology in our lives and not fuck ups industry that they they they benefit from filling that void. Like if you got an issue they got a pill for it. And as soon as you would create that sort of an environment they're going to constantly be innovating and trying to come up with new pills for new issues and even create ailments make up ailments and come up with solutions for those ailments in a lot of those are actually we've shown this on the podcast many times. It was done by advertising agencies. They've actually created names of diseases and issues just so they can come up with Solutions in the research that the most connections was realizing how much of what I have been told was invented not by Scientist by Drug Company POS example my flights Is this so everyone knows anything about taking selfies?

Right? It's like God De Niro in the deer hunter one bullet that is present with us being marketed to as they basically did that with scientific studies for the did is they they they were commissioned a hundred studies 90 of them would say fine mixed results or poll results put in the trash can and the only ones what does one study I think it was like they tested the drug on 247 people and they only publish the results for 27 of them who you will not find out how to get through the 27th Amendment what branch of the early results what? Better than well right. No one says that doesn't happen anymore in New York state is a ticket affect me when I read it cuz it was the drug that I was given as a teenager and Son Co paroxetine Paxil in the US the company that manufactures said he had a leak memory from the Midwest. I say this doesn't work for teenagers, but that I think the phrase that use was this would be unacceptable for the commercial profile of paroxetine. So they just said that it did you see the truck that you were given this company and bulbs that you didn't what people like you write Brian and very powerful side effects weight has also side effects the didn't help you at all. Strong initial based and I would say probably be about probably gave me a very mild based but it didn't solve my problem and the story is told about it. This is B solution because the problem is the chemical imbalance disconnected me from a much wider program every connection in my life, but getting tracks of my depression when I thought so lit right where the so I think the drug companies It's scandalous. What they did is no other drugs have no value they do but when you read through what they actually did in the way these stories were constructed and the the the the the Bulshit, we were told you no remember it's doing a clinical psychologist. It's Lisa Johnson and he's brilliant person and had just saying, you know everything you were told this bullshit. I may just sitting there going through this is what to tell me. This is my job, This one. Ocean for doing that is just stunning think about being inside or trading out the devastating the the penalties are for that this is far worse. What are the scandals is the CIA? How much of it is funded by the drug companies that sell me to mention if you had a a bowl game where one side was fun to wear one of the team's paid the referees wages, right? I think you'd find that guy about the team would win a lot more kiss are those dispassionate judge even know where the rules are constructed. So that drug has been slightly Titan recently, but that was replaced introduced to get a truck tomorrow. You only have to demonstrate to studies anywhere that showed any advocacy. Right? So that means you could have commissioned 3000 studies. I need two of them. It's not that the FBI would take the balance of the research. If you could show to that it what that's what they represent those studies to the FDA. They didn't have to show them everything they've done so you can come to the process of coming onto the market cuz the rules have been slightly tightened and as a result, where will the new ones then not coming on on sunbutt limited more effective in treating depression than antidepressants.
