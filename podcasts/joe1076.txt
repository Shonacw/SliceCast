It's legit. You ready? I wasn't sure you got up to move cameras around Phil show me is too many fanny pack for small compared to try everything. I need and small phone. You take care of a monophone that's like pre-modern phones 6 fits in there 6 plus with the steel problem may be banging against your dick. So what's going on man? So it for everybody who hasn't seen you on the podcast before let's give him a brief synopsis. You were a trainer one time at Marineland and you you're known as The Walrus Whisperer. That's your your handle on Twitter, which I didn't select by the way. He didn't know how did you get it? I was on a TV show called wipe out and it was Grass Roots as hell in Canada. So basically what they do is they float Argentina. They've been the sort of rent the the course and then instead of it being it'll wipe out whatever country this time is Canada, so it was really grasp. And so they told us if you guys can like help advertise so get on your Twitter is get on your this going under that they call me. Walrus whisper. It just made sense to put it. Otherwise, I'll I see her she'll explain while you work for Marineland. You got fired you were you were taking care of this? Walrus? And it it became like a big caused because a lot of people were concerned about the animal safety there and since then they've been sighted like what would have happened with Marineland play all that's.

I'll give you a quick rundown, so I worked at Marineland. I was killer whale trainer how's the guy jumping off the killer whales doing the riot flips off Dolphins? Everything else? I wasn't fired. I quit a missed some to rest a difficult. We're at a lawbreaker basically water disinfection unit broke down and the result wasn't so much to fix it. It was to pump it with more and more chlorine is disinfected a reminder use an ozone generator. So they use ozone in conjunction with the chlorine acid or mitigate the Clarion news. They elected instead or rather the sole control in mind elected to put off actually fixing it and less at night. They're pumping with chlorine. Well, you can just imagine the effect on the hunk time with a little bit of chlorine. Is it a tough time? So I actually quit that affects so it hurt the animals we talked about this earlier shows of people want to go back in time a few years to when you first appeared on the show. It was like some serious issues health issues with dolphins right at their skin is peeling off their they've got all sirs. I mean the sea lions are losing fur in patches bleeding out. I mean just cases at least one animal died and things are getting real bad. 
========,9,title.
And of course my walrus in in all of this is there and she's in the water as well. So this only compounds the issue and the thing about the walrus is its and I use the word allotted anomalous my relationship with she thinks I'm her mom is like a scientific thing to happen or brain circuitry opens. I am print on her. So my smell everything I look like right at you know, cuz you don't answer when she was a baby. She was 2 years old when it happened after makes it kind of just on a baby. That's not a baby know. How old is that in the walrus world? The dog years know she's still young and you know how I am dog years if baby is yet to be racist is not but she's fairly young and you were a caretaker. So she imprinted that you were her parent of a traumatic thing that happened we we were drawing blood from them because back then, you know, they're not trained to to accept the pain of drawing blood and so she wasn't condition for this they were young we had to get blood so we are actually doing a job on another walrus and she was sort of loose running out and we were wrestling her down and and Sushi come over she's climb and hectic and crazy and she still almost 300 pounds at that point. If you got a mover she's she's climbing all over you it's a big obstruction. So I should have put my hands in front of her face and that's what happened. I'm telling you that you could it was like a magical moment all of a sudden something happened and she just looked at me her eyes changed. I change. I was not a different person. I'm not her mom. She was following me to walk down away from the scene. Just follow me and from that moment on she never stopped and What's the score between the base if our relationship is that? I've sort of raised her. So do do you put like the touch on her back for the touch on it with these two hands right here in Forever face and what it is that a normal thing with animals. Like I said, it it almost never happens. You care if animals imprinting on humans long time. Usually it at her age that was going to bed so that to happen usually happens when they're very young right if it's going to happen yet. It does happen when people raised bears and a lot of weird animals that you wouldn't ordinarily think it's Pat's I don't have it would be an actual imprint like the imprint is different is one thing of familiarize crying all the time. She ate while it's just it's natural. She's protective of me. She will not leave my side. I mean I could walk to the edge of the Earth with her. She'll be beside. You can't do everything. Is she still at Marineland right now? Yes, I haven't seen any updated photos in sometime. So I can't be absolutely sure but yeah fairly sure but she's hitting they won't they do not bring her on this place. Not on display. You're not going to find it. They hide behind the pinniped basically seals sea lions and walruses. They bring in her case. She doesn't perform anymore when she comes out. She's not reliable. You can't get to do anything. All she does is goes out of state and she looks for me frantically, so it's not reliable. So they bring up between shows occasionally so she can see the Sun and that's it. And so, you know, I've got to have people in there with video cameras ready and it's tough, but we get the videos we get the information I need So what's going on with you and them now cuz there's been a series of lawsuits and is one of the reasons why you want to come in here and talk, right? So they've so they should be a course frivolously. They fit suit me with plotting to steal a walrus is the is the there allegation. This isn't 2000s actually fighter anniversary comes up on plotting to steal. Walrus. Did you try to get her out of there know if I tried to get her today know I have nowhere to put a walrus. Well, that's not true. I do have a river in the front yard, but I have no interest in releasing her into the Niagara River and then watch over the faucet. I have no interest. So now I'm nothing like that. I don't have a beachfront Arctic home to carry or two, but he was number of people. And yes, we just elected to try to fight as long as we could try to sustain This legal battle because you know a lawsuit you got to review a lot of information a lawsuit. It's not fun like this the real inside everything from iPhone to like maybe not physically but I've given to you mean everything like your phone the phone graduations. I have everything that meant. So if they sue you for trying to take a walrus, they didn't actually try to take they can get access to your phone records. They can ruin your life. Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything they can get access to your phone or why would they have access to your phone records? They have I have a legal obligation of giving them anything that is relevant to their claim. So be it Communications be if they can read all your text messages read all your emails read. They got something they don't build their keys everything. Wow, it's crazy and I have zero from them after 5 years because they're using the system as a means to be abused me and acting the fool as they're real. Legal team does exception proves proved very effective in abusing a guy like me wear as a corporation with endless amount somebody just shoot the shit out of me. So they're basically just suing you to punish you and try to keep other people from doing the same thing in talking out about them. They've sued media.

They've sued a student 18 year old kid from California who didn't eat it was a yet-to-be-released a project movie. He made almost like a cartoon. It was in the in the key of Marineland kind of the last remaining Orca kiska, and they shooting for a million bucks cuz I assume that settled now, I don't know enough and there's no way of knowing that I haven't heard anything of it, but and what was their lawsuit based on? They are at least in what I think I just scan the documents, but they allege that I can remember this house at work when they sue someone from California. Does he have to go to Camp? That's interesting. I don't know actually that's felt it was so confusing but I was like shooting Americans and stuff. Like I don't know if that were stationed another writer. In fact as well as an American writer. They'll give a shit the basidia didn't they get they get find recently. So then something happened along those lines charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty a little over a year ago. I was in court, of course, Marineland Suzhou SPCA for 21 million alleges agency wanted to destroy the theme park. So that's what we're gone. So basically down the road over the course of okay, I got to get into this okay of the charges. They have 11 charges of animal cruelty first. They were five at five or six and then and then additional five or six now there's a total of 11 charges for animal cruelty that we might have to go to court to defend against a dragon on his always. I'm in court every freaking day you can bet your ass even even one time there was a it was a confidential meeting. In fact, it was not for public local writer knock on the door cuz her to walk in the lawyers are looking at us like the fuck you doing here, but with a cake like tweets it in the crown and the OSPCA for the crown the crown. That's the one who'd be laying charges the animal cruelty. What is the crown with the crowd is like the is the Justice he He sent me the judge Atlanta's public land. So right so I imagine that's probably why it's called Crown. I don't know. 
========,9,title.
I'm not I'm not a legal expert but nonetheless so they're in their negotiating and basically the animal cruelty charges are pursued is they have to meet two thresholds. Number one. You have to have a reasonable chance of conviction number to asking the Public's interest to pursue. Sears the first charges were immediately dropped because it's been driving me crazy for years that this has been going on that continues. But if I make a complaint the USB C in my photo of an atom of which of course I did that is clearly damaged and fucked up. If they don't physically have evidence of who it is that's actually harming the animal. There's no cruelty. They can't do anything. So in that case, they dropped a lot of the charges against really because the evidence didn't actually point to anyone specifically it was just evidence of damaged animals. So they threw a punch out but then there was a bunch that were that they did have a good chance of a conviction and this is where Marineland promised the crown that this was going to be a very expensive process long and drawn-out process and the crown agreed that it didn't meet the Threshold at Dixie the threshold of being in the public public interest in spending a lot of of public dollars per serving these charges and so they dropped the rest of them Marineland turned around and Sue's the OSPCA for 21 million dollars claiming that it was malicious prosecution that of course, they didn't name me specifically but I'm always here named Marineland employee in that and they allege that I threatened to defund them and all they think I'm this Keyser Soze like character, which I don't mind playing up a little bit strings all over the place. Half exists hop. I think there's the employees there that think that I'm like so they they get brought up on 11 charges of animal cruelty the charges get dropped and they turn around. Sue the government 21 million-dollar the same government that let him off for a year is the OSPCA has been complacent are complicit in in in allowing Marineland to operate as they have unimpeded for them fifty fifty years. They had a good relation tree line if I donated the land of which the Niagara Falls Humane Society is built on which is where the OSPCA operates on a plaque on the wall until after 2012 research spoke out that honored Marineland owner John holder for his generosity. That was my weight. What moment holy fuck big guy thinks things started to change real fast when they wanted realized the depth of which Marineland was sort of in with all levels of government really all levels of government. And so they Continue to sort of allow for them to do these things. But but they're suing the government. Yeah and possibly be in bed with the government and sue him or the Canadian Association of zoos and Aquarium, which you stack Reddit all the zoos in Canada or still does their credit them. So they try to try to say all this is a good zoo. It's accredited Marineland. I believe also threatened them because they were not going to renew their their their agreement this year. And so Marineland claimed to have left them and they said, you know, where are in a phase of development right. Now, we're going to just leave this Canadian Association do some crap tops of the bullshit. They were. They were so they're out of friends. That's for sure finally, but it took a lot to eat shit to get finally get that to get that real issue. And your mind is the way they treat the animals the way they run their business. Right, cuz I expand now into just arguing that those animals should not be in in real life possession be altogether the whales that has done. It should be done done. It should be done and I think after Blackfish me before you came on or when you cave on it was before Blackfish it been released and then once people saw what actually happens to these super intelligent animals when you lock them up swimming pools late, they're starting to realize it and SeaWorld attendance is down and people are down on the whole idea. Especially killer whales I mean God, they just did giant Majestic animals. It seemed so fucked up to put them in these tanks and two separate them for families and the emotional distress. They go to a firm believer that the emotionally we don't even haven't the slightest sense of how complex they can be right because they don't have an ability to express himself to us and other than eating us occasionally and that's killer whales only do in captivity.

Captivity Dawn lucky enough life in the pool with a pissed-off killer whale have you? Oh, yeah. I jumped in one time. I was told me about hi. I was having a show with her and then she sucks the pumper telling you dive down with her. She'll follow you everywhere you go and then it's like flying a plane that it's amazing that you just woke up and then she just takes it to the moon and she's screaming underwater when she's having a good time or rather when she's expressing herself that she's going to Tasha this particular time. When when I was when I probably shouldn't have gone in the Water by while she was pissed I can see in her eyes. How could you tell that? She's pets know the animals lick it. I mean, that's the whole basis of being a trainers to get to know the animals know their behavior know everything about them. You spend a lot of time with them. What are the indications? So in this case I was so the way those two shows work. I mean they don't they don't exist anymore. But back in the day was You work the animal initially just to get a sense of their demeanor. So you got them jump and you got to run around to get a gauge. Do you know you got a good sense of how they are on a particular day. She just wasn't responding real quick. Her eyes are a little big picture with a focus on me. She looking elsewhere. She's sort of drifted off of it. I just didn't really have her attention, but I think I don't know what maybe I had my dad that I want to jump off her. So I look at the senior trainer the time she's like that. I go to jump in I get to the edge of the pool. She's standing directly above or below me. I dive over her. She she lunges at me and she snaps and I see it from below be like I see under that sheet and snapped at me snapped at you like tried to bite you feel like if she really wanted to bite you she was so was it a bite bite? Definitely a warning but otherwise, I wouldn't be here tonight. She if you are that's what I'm saying. Like it's no way I would miss know she's not going to be in the water and I'm out at the top of the water and instead she's not inverted upside down and she's swimming and she's circling the boots which side down for the pool that's going to trigger some response out of her that I don't necessarily want to know. So I'm saying, why would that happen? I think that if she doesn't why you're the pool, you're not getting out if I if I start trying to race out she knows I'm trying to get out. She was going to be able to stand me up there. Just keep me in and I don't want to know where that's going on. That's interesting. So you knew that you had to stay in there then. Choice that's that's the best course of action at this point because I'm not going to win a race out of that pool. And so now I'm up right she comes to the surface and I see her dorsal fin and she's coming pretty quickly at me and I put my hands up like this never forget. It's your tail down arch your back up stops dead at me. It's a big wake-up and I put my hands on a Rostrum. I just sort apricot, and then I put my feet on her pack takes me to the stage she dunks down and then she picks me up put me on the stage that sorta back away. Like wow. Thank you. Thank you for like being nice to me. I had a friend's dad one time there and I just don't touch the big male sea lion to me. They got big teeth and they're not typically breastfeed, but I could see that this is another time of course, but I can see that she's losing patience and she did the same thing. As soon as we turned our back. I said don't even know what maybe we should just step away as soon as he turned his back to go. She lunged the same thing. 
========,9,title.
It's crazy man, and I was just so they don't have killer whale shows there any more wild that killed that particular killer whale kiss cuz she's ever going to be realized never going to get another one. She's been sort of unresponsive for a long time sun a lot of medication medication or tons of medication while she's got different. I mean on an antibiotic antibiotic you get them on. Can you take blood from a killer whale flip over and they got out they've got a Thinkin their tail. There's a series of large veins. You just roll them over did let you know Everything is Everything is Everything is trained in that voluntarily so I can take a long time to train these things but you're training sets and you just break it. You just literally got this little needle you put it in the in the vein. They don't get pissed at you. They get pissed if you miss me keep trying. Fuc. Yeah. I've seen it happen, but they let you take their blood. They're healthy and responsibly, of course if they're not there's nothing is going to get you to the vet get them to the edge of the pool. But so you take their blood and then they what are they find voice levels how the stress is you want to look at white blood count see if they're funny and infections, you know, if it's always it's always something a lot of the animals are in fact on Valley and a lot of different things that that is like rampant used in Infinity aquarium. Marineland are not just rely on SeaWorld everywhere. Yeah, absolutely, like dolphins dolphins Round Valley Mall timeshare. I when I was when I was when I left Marineland, I had the agreement big and I left fairly amicable considering the situation by tonight. I want to play my cards right and realize I want to call me back in specifically to help a dolphin and it was to figure of course. I wish that wasn't a Daily Mail. What's the what's the other one the dodo the dodo Goodwin BuzzFeed? Let's go with BuzzFeed. SeaWorld puts is Wales on valent volume like drug documents a Cheese's fuck. It was documents are from a lawsuit between marine land and sea world or SeaWorld submarine Len Dawson with killer whales a psychoactive drug benzodiazepine according to the sworn affidavit filed in order to Ontario superior court of justice in dispute between the park company in the Rival company Greenland or the transport of a prize killer whale I take a i k k i k, is if you watch Blackfish you got Telecom, that's the order that when I killed yet. That's that's Tilikum son. We had this song. Wow, we had him he was in captivity right in captivity in a pool by himself for the Moses raised and bred in captivity and he was turning aggressive and It was like they were having none of it. They wanted that killed a while back and I don't blame you. It's amazing. I'm sued for Millions because I'm a legend that that Marineland is mistreating their animals Seaworld Seuss Marina because they're mistreating. They're not taking proper care of the killer whale that actually win lawsuit. They would not put any barriers around the pool. We got a date or green. I have a large pool maginus unimpeded ability to touch a killer whale if you wanted to reach. It's not a safe idea. This is absurd. In fact, it's just when you're dealing with a large boisterous male Orca, so she wanted barriers around it. So that people can't get close and you can't tell him what to do. He's not going to do nothing anyone tells me what to do. So suddenly we're dealing with the fact that this and I'll start at the lunch at the public. This is an animal that if it gets a hold of someone it's over there with him for a bit. We can hear a lot of screaming but the screaming will end you not getting anyone out of it that killer whales mouth forget it and this is what cereal was dealing with are just like shit. That enough bad, press even back then if I take a kill someone or hurt someone or anything or dies and relives care.

It's going to look and see what's so she was killed people killed how many people one person is raining in Victoria Canada? First one then he went to I think it's absolutely hilarious. They kept and kept doing things for the Apple watch doesn't realize that one grizzly bear. That was a train grizzly bear for films. It was in what's that movie Something 40 some football movie with a big bear. Anyway, the Bear kill the guy's brother cousin got was just standing. It's horrible video you watch the video. I seen it the guy just standing there in the bear just decide to tell the guy Copart just reaches up bites and rips his throat open the guy runs off grab his neck. He's dead within minutes. The joys of working with animals man Dominion job are they kept alive and they started training him again, and there's some really weird footage of the guy training the bear again. There's one from the Will Ferrell movie that Semi-Pro. Yes Semi-Pro. That's the dog the dog. That's the bear. Bear fucking kill. Somebody. Look this guy smacking his bear out with will the bear eventually killed somebody just got tired of people it takes nothing for him so easy for him. Yeah, just decided if I come up but now when Tilikum was doing all this he was on valium. All right, I can't say for sure that that was the case. I lied. I want to be sued anymore. They start putting killer whales on valium. sew in in Ocean oceanariums volume is often used as an appetite stimulant. So when your animal is off, so they don't they don't eat if they're not responding to buckets of food. You're fuck you having to drop the water to get access to because you're not interested no more than other friends anymore. If you don't have a bucket of food forget about it, and so pissed off enough to trigger that appetite your pom pom with the volume volume. If you don't want to eat stuff written while then you get liquid on you can inject as well if the injection something that's a process the things that I've seen and done that were normal to me and normal to any one of his work in there is insane.

Like what we should drop the call this Beluga rodeo and ever amen real is notorious for having like I wish I say we over V that puts their pushing 60 balloons at this point. This is why it's so important these fucking laws because this is absurd and it creates a whole world of problems. Of course socially for these animals babies get killed by males. It's it's Gross, it's bad. It's not manageable. Nonetheless. What we would do is we drop the water where the pool so you have. I mean anywhere between 10 and 15 belugas flat on their stomach. There's a great at the bottom of the can't move like a well if they want to move they can put their flopping around but it means going to get fucked up bad like scratched up by the the ground. So if you've got maybe a little bit of water we we've tried different things to try to mitigate how damaged up they got there was one time I make a card that we used to call it. I mean, it's morbid but we should go brownies call to Cesar water because it was blood red by the time we were done by procedures. I'm telling you how it would make you sick. It was at the water was too thick of blood and so one time there was a it was a beluga named Peanut and she started to panic and what she did was she repeatedly slander tail in a panic set the bounce around like a fucking basketball shoes. Get are 3 ft in the air to steal. She's probably a 3000 pound whale 2010 Whaler something so you're not going to stop that would try to jump on it chunks of her tail. I'm not joking. Cartel flying off fly up if anyone goes to Marineland glass canopy. Go take a look at her. Her tail. There's nothing left of it. She's got like a nut that sort of like you would Jagged on the bottom just fucked up after that again lots of Madras recovery, but it was Philemon. So is this this benzodiazepine? Is this a recent thing? They start doing to I wouldn't say so I can't vouch for any time before 2000 when I started but for sure once we were there in the middle of the one you go to SeaWorld and you see those killer whales and dolphins doing shows they're just pilled up out of their fucking minds. It's it's hardly assembly. It's merely a semblance of their wild counterparts. You're not going there and seeing a dynamic animal noise you're seeing a depressed drugged confused probably frustrated animal and it's difficult for people to give a shit about anything if it doesn't affect them personally if you see an animal going through this if you feel that you start to appreciate also, Weird even calling them animals. I feel like like killer whales and dolphins in particular are so fucking intelligence. It's hard to call them animals. I mean obviously humans are animals as well, but they are their own thing. I mean those marine mammals are their own thing. They have their own world and they dominated it. Yeah, and then their world man if it's a fucking amazing world this day, they're one of the only animals that we know of that has a really complex language and we can't even decipher it and then just last week Marineland Francis is talking about Wikipedia is a killer whale that just picked up she mimics she mimics human voice. So they've got her saying like hello. Hi in these different things that sort of sounds like she's mimicking where she started seeing a bunch of race or should racial slurs. Well, then let's get her and capture of dolphin yesterday. But the capture is it's already illegal in the United States right while you you you have to go to the get them from Canada and Canada get some from being captured can get them from anywhere this so basically the department of fisheries and oceans. Very strategically talked about the sweeping overhaul of the of whatever this thing whenever it isn't the word elude me, but they did this. I believe anyways to sort of mitigate some Justin Trudeau went off about the the Kinder Morgan pipeline service here and it's not it's a big pipeline that the run this oil in BC and that's what he run on the campaign that you wouldn't do this for just your thoughts about saving the world little time and wrapping up the environment. That's a good piece of legislation. It doesn't band the breeding. It doesn't address a lot of things that were actually addressing with Bill s-203 which is two years ago that marine land is managed to get this guy this Senator to keep playing again acting the fool doing all these creative ways to kill this bill and that's where we're at now even though I expect some time next week together now, so if this this Bill Sherman past and brought into the house a long time ago, and I'm not the case Still. Still stalled having it again. It's all lobbying illegal. 
========,9,title.
Which may or may not turn into some problems for a senator done play correct me if I'm wrong, but for a while some of the some of the parks in the United States would get them from some of the parks in Canada, which would get them from Russians and Chinese would capture them in the wild that sold. So the parks United States would say that they don't capture Wells. So what they would do is Marine, I would capture a little wild ones and then once they would do it personally while they would pay some Russians to capture the Russian so they bring the whales in Wild those what those those whales have been since the other side. Cap is now deemed captive-born and now it can be shipped to the states. And so it's what I was doing was just reading like crazy and it's ending of SeaWorld and that's how we got the the show about to begin with how we got High cake. I was going to pick trade with belugas. That's what I try to put an end to because all these loopholes, you know, I'm really really capitalize done this a long time lobbying the government for years and then they've been around for for 50 plus years. They've had they've done All the Right Moves a businessman would do if he wants to keep in a thriving Business Without too many hands to keep them from doing anything. It's just so disturbing that were willing to just accept this because we don't know what they're saying, you know, we know that they have a really complex language. We can't decipher it though because it's so alien in terms of with the sounds they make it's not something you put into a box but it's not like any other animal between dolphins and killer whales and Wales in general. They did make sounds in with a range of complexity that's just unrivaled in nature outside of humans and auditory system is so complex when you put them in a we put in a concrete pool. Imagine what I mean? I, I put my ears under the water that's loud filters are going you got different sounds anymore by water being pushed in from this pipe and that by Screamin Eagle streaming music louder louder louder popcorn. Jennifer Anderson, it's almost like they're kind of them in there. Definitely not human but they're kind of people they like a water people. It's weird it if you if you put yourself in the mindset of looking at an animal and try to change your perception of them a little bit rather than than a disassociating and you look at me you can actually see the other people manic that's that's just a different meat suit, you know that I can deal with killer whales and stuff highly Dynamic populations. They they live in these very intimate groups. They stay together for Life a male killer whale will never leave its mother's side over its life. I will stay within about a body's length its entire life. I must deposit beating like that. I'll just stay up on the other side of the Pod for a while and if they have that luxury of Escape, what is in captivity males get the shit kicked out of a big male. Murder is killing people but I've always felt so bad for this big male beautiful big bull male. He was just it was rocked his existence. I've been pulled from his mother and this is really large explains my telekom when you ruin their lives that's over that mean they're holed the reason they live member to the remembered a mother fuc man. It's just why do we allow this? It seems to me like like almost a form of slavery may I don't want to diminish the horrors of human slavery because in human slavery, at least there's no question whatsoever that that's a human and there's communication. Yeah, so it's it's as awful as it gets but God damn foot put the ignorance decide the slavery of killer whales is like really close. It's really close the only way to get them to work. Effectively and efficiently is to keep them hungry hungry. So let me just make a bigger pool for the killer whales we gave them what they really still are they like what you're showing natural behaviors, which is which natural behavior. Let him go fuc up a whale shit. They put a fact they put like a like a backdrop of a couple trees assumption. I got a new show A SeaWorld in some of the craziest Economy Inn in California. She was a singer promise II. Stop Banning. Did they promise to stop reading the killer whales but these fucking promises don't do not believe for a moment that they're like some type of response with corporate citizens go hold on to this thing. It's bullshit.

So intent to you about the business entity that try to make money at Store California did was they they went out and Bandit so in California you can Breed orcas an import-export issues of all that but in Florida, so I can't see what makes the promise they have Norco protection act that they were looking to do exactly California going to put it in there to make it concrete passed a law that way that way she will caches backpedal on it by road, which I won't suspect they will see what is lobbying like fucking crazy and just just last week's successfully defeated the bill again. They're putting a lot of effort world is trying to defeat a bill that multiple times including they just last week and that allows them or they visible with keep them from breeding these animals in captivity Sperry fighting against that successfully fighting it's over in Florida while they're pretending in California. They don't want to breed them well know in California, they actually passed the law to stay there cuz I'm so lost in the Florida if it was defeated repeatedly and no fun town. So they're trying their trying to breed animals in captivity. And if they do Bredemann floor, they'll be able to ship them to California to China. So that's what it is right now. And in fact SeaWorld was just bought Chinese Corporation, I just named they just named one of the one of the guys to the SeaWorld bored. And so what people mean it's safe to assume that this is exactly what's happening at SeaWorld. This is planning an exit strategy and they're going to start sending Orchestra to China celibate. And so they're still capturing them in the wild in China. It's it's a it's a burgeoning booming industry. Man, 44 ocean theme parks in China right now Jesus building a crazy how many of them are in the United States for sure. I was actually surprised to read there's like three hundred something dolphins in captivity in the state. I then I think I was a number I saw I didn't realize there was that big I had no idea that there was that many in captivity in the States but just seems to be such an archaic thing that it just I can't imagine that the United States wants to keep doing that. The fact that SeaWorld is trying to keep doing that in Florida that they've successfully lobbied to allow them to keep reading these animals in captivity, but you can't once you have them in captivity for a long time save SeaWorld wanted to release them. They can't really release them. There's nowhere to release them and that's what's being worked on. Now. There's a project called the whale Sanctuary project and I suspect they'll be a fairly large announcement soon. I believe they'll be looking at a location in the in Canada and they're going to build this thing. Then there will be a place for them, which is a great place to do it because.

Why you go coastal? Of course, I mean, you got to be in the ocean to get pen off and I already got to be there lots of things to consider. You got to make sure there's a lot of water changes a lot of different things cuz you can't keep the animal in something that's going to stagnate in a minute. So it's going to be some sort of a cage and offense of sorts around maybe like a fjord. I won't be a few yard if it's in Canada, but like just imagine jump It is a smashing that will make certain that that's not the case. But I've seen I've seen dolphins jump out of the pool. That's crazy rushed in one morning to call them because cuz I thought they jumped out the pool. Holy shit that I mean that's a wake-up call when you get there. And you see the same flopping Around Me Like Jesus Christ and I didn't do well together first different slings and things that you know, the movies dolphin so I know the dolphin weigh 500 lb 600-lb in this case, you should choose a decent size female. So I went and grabbed it a kid a ticket to early morning Rush him in on my dude. I got two guys like we got to get this dolphin and he's never done that before your jaws on the floor by a fucking had these two still pulls on my shoulders dolphin in the sling lifting I swear to you on my back went backwards like this. It was the heaviest thing. I never carry but we got her back in it was crazy. But had jumped out of it was crazy. In fact, there was a time in the summer. I remember where one of our Dolphins were teetering on the edge what you would do if she always spyhopping like this looking over the edge of the crowd explain that the people that were just listening. So I'm so just listen to look over. Jump up on the legend Balance shoes on eight foot drop to the concrete on the other side of the school. She's up there posing. I'm hearing the crowd. I'm going crazy. You have fun doing this. Holy shit. That's the dolphin that junk. That's what we did with I said, we got to take her out of this pool. We took her out put her in the back pool where no one would see requests and that's the next day. She actually jumped so I should be dead today if we hadn't moved her then of course, I really did was put up flick more get them or obstruction things to keep getting in the pool. So I know when you find her outside of the pool, how long has she been outside for she was still wet? So it wasn't so bad but one one dolphin was we found her that she got stuck on the stage overnight and when we got there her skin had become so dry that it was it was starting to crack his kind of fucked-up. She actually has this permanent Scar from her house until like When she realizes people trying to help her. I got the aware what's going on or she in a pan? They always fight they always fight if they don't allow me this particular dolphin was a fighter every time we ever try to put her in a sling a new run me one time. I can go back to memories. I can I can remember my thoughts during this time and we had her in a sling hovering over the pool. And the way the sling is as you got two holes in a sling where the pets go in right pectoral fins. And then one with a gentle slit is the shit than one that's stuck in the in the sling butt and then you got crane a top. So now you got this thing lifted over the pool while she's fighting like crazy and we can see that there's a tear in the sling as she's fighting fighting. Why do we get the cream just gets over the pool to sling rich is plugged in the pool holyshit man weave sling don't like a 10000 pound killer whales over like 30-40 feet in the air like a wake up call. Wow, okay procedures man, moving these these things the things that especially at a place like Marineland when you stepped through the doors and hopefully you don't but if you do it's like you've gone back to the 70s in this hurt their business. Attendance is abysmal over there. They're crushed. I've I live right ice. I watch the sunset over Marineland from my front yard. It's a beautiful sight I drive by and just about every day. 
========,9,title.
Their attendance is rotten agra falls, which is where it is where Marineland is is booming. The tourism is through the roof. You can't shoulder-to-shoulder over there and relax seeing none of it. If you think it's because people know about the conditions are absolute. I got a lot of support in the local community let people know exactly what's going on. A Taurus is a little more difficult than you know Falls welcomes millions of them. So you're going to get a fraction of that but it is a fraction ruins not benefiting from the booming tourism. They're on their way out there on a clock for sure for sure. I'd be shocked to tear them opening in 2019. I'm not going to make that prediction but I would be shocked. It's it's not bad but to be fair there's no investors at Marina and it's one so controlling mine owner who started with nothing. So two thousand bucks built this thing he is indebted to nobody. He's now it's cash which of course and he's got a lot of fucking money and A lot of times he's out the function of I wouldn't be surprised to not on a time in life. You mean he's like 84 years old now to think that he's rationalizing his mind to just fucking sewer this thing like destroy all our lives, but just take the park in the process. Fuck it. Wow, he's very paranoid and defiant man. And so I need 4 years old. What else does he have left to accomplish? I guess you were saying that 50 beluga whales. Turn off remember if we ever actually wait or big mad a gas at 4000 lb 85/15 of those 50 of them are usually get tasked with here's your here's your scuba gear. Here's a size of a football field goal catch that beluga whale that me and my buddies were okay. Here we go. It really would be amazing to be able to capture the things we've done on video. Can you recognize the difference in intelligence between killer whales Dolphins beluga whales similar cunning smart you turn your back and they're pickpocketing you I mean, they are just and they're brats. I love Brad start bratty. I know you're having fun with you like to make things difficult know how to frustrate you like an exercise that so it's always a mental game, especially with like kind of skittish. So I don't know if that's a reflection of their intelligence necessarily but I would call them like maybe maybe a hint more dum dum then then the next one right but not the only one they don't like me. You're not as smart as dolphins and I wouldn't say so in some way some way intelligent out there who goes in the in the in the in the whale world do whales respond to respond to verbal commands? yeah, yeah, so in the case of pinnipeds absolutely, so she'll see lights that are walruses seals sea lions respond to we I couldn't say for sure in my experience that was the case. However in the case of just been announced it last week of that animal mimicking the the the human sounds it mean she hears them. So if you can hear if that we can hear you, but you can definitely created a cute shorts to never answered her behavior. It's possible that they can know some of our language. I don't know that they could recognize some commands. Yeah. I wonder why don't we know that they have dialects right? But we don't know anything that they're saying right know and that's what's interesting is I beat myself up wondering if in fact they're using a language that is to be interpreted. That's words. The sentences versus sounds that mean things is different in a Barka barkstar bookmarks on the other words and if they are maybe they're fuck you. I don't know but I was listening is thing about monkeys. I think it was Steven pinker's book where they were talking about. How old is audiobook they were talking about how monkeys have differentiated the sound that they make if there is a tiger versus a sound they make if there's an eagle I'm walking around I hear squirrel in a tree making a certain sound. I know there's a cat in vicinity of a language like a very crude language, but what they've done is taken the sound of an eagle and they play in your Monkees The Monkees look up Carson and they play the sound of a monkey trying to alert the fact that there's a tiger in the area The Monkees run up trees and start looking down. Yeah. It's really interesting cuz like A few sounds that they can repeat and they know for a fact that these monkeys know what they're talking about in monkeys even play jokes. That's a language each other. They play jokes on each other like of one monkey wanted a banana. He would say, hey man is a fucking Eagle here in the monkey would run up a tree and he would get the banana like they would they lie to each other. It's pretty fascinating makes doing fucked-up things to them that much worse right? You mean monkeys? The mean we know that they're intelligent but they got a little tiny little tiny brain little tiny ass had little tiny brain, you know, but it's all I need orcas brain does Derek chianese are huge enormous brains dolphin's brain. So she don't bring your way bigger than ours. 
========,9,title.
You want to hear fucked-up story. I swore I had to dig up a dead killer whale to extract a portion of his brain that we missed during a necropsy. Ya dig it up then it was like I was in the ground is she had been buried for like 10 days to a dude. How did I I can't remember how candy died exactly but it did like pretty young. I can't remember exactly what the what the final you said about. We're always told you I was in was always meningitis and meningitis or or they would say a twisted intestine or something. They always asking questions rather than feeling clammy, whatever conclusive in that regard, but on this particular case in this particular case, they ask you something fucked-up. Can you go get to people shoot em up. We got to go get a piece of brain. We missed a lot of candy. I'm just like I can't possibly impose upon someone to do that. I can't how deep it has been buried like to say feed he was and you can just do that in the yard. They allow you just bury it in the yard Murray. Let us Mass graves in the back and the exact place that they're claiming development. Now we have Possible to have two roads pretty close to it to where the bodies are buried forget about. I mean realign breeds more deer and that why do they breed dear? It's got this got a whole pack of animals different animals. That's what I have a cookie charges stem from was actually it was not right now because there's no laws taking them. So did you know the container living avoid of protection but the the the the deers the Bears there's no laws in Canada Canada yet. It's common man. I've been talking about this for five years. We're almost there. But first come on here 2013 was my first time here. So that would have been four years ago and thousands of graves in the back thousands of animals in large groups of this big hole for instant. There's a big hole for the deer. They're all going in there the bed to the Earth. You still talking Christmas back in the day when he used to when the owner used to host Christmas party should go back and Slaughter buys and then feed burgers and make food out of that stuff and things to do that. Don't do something in game farm and then by by being a farmer classified as a farm, he was actually able to kill and produced food. I've been told that happened know. Why did they kill deer back there into a pole? Because they're they're gross like disgusting dog. I got to eat. Some of them are going to get injured these things happened. So that night would happen is someone let's say we drive around in his truck and put the gun out the window just eat. Did you just go on a shooting spree? He's wiping out these I was in the morning the land animal care doesn't show up in to be like, okay go go pick up the body for kids. So what are you doing on for a goof or what you do it cuz he's trying to thin the pop. Malaysian cuz there's too many of them or we wouldn't be anything like that in one case. Once once the investigation came out in 2012 which revealed of course abuse with land animals as well. They went on a calling spree. 
========,9,title.
If you will where they got rid of some of the uglier sort of less healthy animals offsite the more beautiful animals that they have them are not on display that actually back their breeding off out of display. That's where the two dog. I left recall when the owner shot those two Labs beautiful little Labrador dogs went running into the up-and-down the running up and down the fence across from memory lane owners house, which is where the off-site pennies representatives and that's where he decided. I'm not calling anyone to come get these analyst the story. So heartbreaking. It just pulled out of shotgun kills one. The other one cow hours as because it was a witness the witness never identified themselves. They want to be sued and then he shoots the other one and then he tells of land Animal Care supervisor. Take to just take the colors off the dogs go bury him in the pit. It was I was there that day. I got heard the gunshots. I was there when the vet got the phone calls. She's like, oh my God, okay with me cuz John just killed two dogs. Dogs that you can go ahead go back home puppies do their beautiful dogs. That was a video. It's since been taken down on the trumps Star website. A lot of videos are. A lot of things are happening now on account of these lawsuits and further down the road that we've gone where things are starting to disappear. There was a it was a very powerful historical website about Marineland in some of the owners history and you know, these things are gone now, they're gone. I mean, I can't allege as to why or what Agreements are if there are agreement. I I can't go down that road to suggest. I don't know a lot of these resources that I hate that were very powerful are gone disappearing now. So he's this Marineland has his giant yard, right? How many acres are you talking about where there's thousands of animals buried in the park is massive it is there is more there's probably three times undeveloped land vs. What developer and it's a big part that's sort of bear and there's not a lot of things is ryzen. You going to walk a mile between a but none the less he like to do was was certificate. Are a lot of land over his lifetime that that was his thing he own half and agra falls. I got to watch my step if I had to Marineland to keep protesters off of their site, which is absolute bullshit and thought it was a listing for city. Council MLP. Do you got to fix that? Cuz that's some horseshit right there. And then that you guys have been pattern for too long. I mean to keep us from being able to protest that's horseshit. Then why do you think that is because they just don't want to get sued there was a time when Marineland and owner were called like the king of Niagara. That was Marineland was Atop The Hill that was the Falls came second to Marineland. At least one of them played that they had this idea that people came to Niagara Falls. They would see the Falls since they look out of 10 minutes and then they would have no reason to stay they were saying they're bringing all this business because people are now going to hotels going to restaurants and then go to Marineland the next day. And so and when did this change? When did Ray Allen go to ship? Yeah, 2012. So right when you left so before then is as thriving thing and just nobody knew about the conditions. That's what I was worried about people who have known who's going to talk. It's not new for Marineland owner or Marineland the corporation to sue people for speaking out to dinner before and successfully not in the sense that there was any judgment but successfully in that the people that spoke to pay portal price and silenced. So no one wants to speak out against that I get it. I mean, I'm eating it now. It's been 5 years 5 years of everyday waking up wondering if this is the fucking one where you're done, you know, so you've been embroiled in these lawsuits for 5 year 5 years. 
========,9,title.
I'm on they sue me on Valentine's Day 2013 yet. And nothing's been resolved. The only way that there could be a resolve at this point is if I were to sign a document and I'm assuming at this point because we realize that nothing in terms of any type of agreement but down the road it's their objective is to shut me up. They want to wipe out the last 20 years of my life. They don't want me to open my mouth about anything and of course in Last 5 Years and then the 12 prior, you know, where to refill everything that's going out to try to shut me out. They want me they want an injunction permanent injunction. I assumed they would that to keep me from being able to go to the park with us because very conflicting for me because they have a walrus sort of Hostage there and I do I do dream of a day of being reunited with her and I imagine it would have to take place on Marineland property some day. So it's really not prepared to sign anything. In fact, I told my lawyer just last week. It's a non-starter and I'll remind Marineland now non-starter, they'll never shut me up. I'm not signing it. I'll have to eat shit forever, but I'm not going to sign it. So, where do you anticipate this all going when you been in a Pro long legal battle for 5 years. Now. What what do you anticipate this going? And so in April the last time I was here two years ago and I solicited some some some help resources to be able to pursue Marineland owner in that. I want him to be examining Court much. Like I have in the same capacity that I had to forfeit all of my communication. I want the same for the corporation and I want to examine Marineland owner has represented this proved very difficult. It took mean we got the order only just last April to examine and we thought we won the order. And since then we've tried multiple times to schedule and we're almost out of here now trying to schedule this man to come in for examinations, and he's not showing up couple times now. and so At some point if Marineland doesn't want the fact out there. That's what I'm pursuing. I want the facts out there. They're going to have to we're going to have to settle and so how that ends with me. I don't know. I'm not looking for money. I can give a shit about trying to get rich in this thing. Are you trying to sue them for money though? I'm suing them. Yeah, but it's a much numbers don't matter or something. So would the million-and-a-half unlimited would it be predicated on you would have to shut your mouth if it wasn't something I went to do if it wasn't a judgement that the judge made friends with a trial the judge makes their decision then if we settle before and it's because it was about to wash my hands and walk away real is not going to wash their hands of me unless I feel unless I got them properly cornered only way they want to get me is course. They want to ruin me, right? How could you properly Corner them? What would be well if Marineland zoners missed a couple examinations now how many until I can go in and actually file a motion to have the entire statement claim dismissed about fact is pretty So my objective is to go and get this lawsuit thrown out at which point they've only got the I've got the counterclaim for them to work with their not suing me no more. Now who's got the upper hand. That's my dream. But that's your dream. 
========,9,title.
But if if that doesn't happen made it seems like five years is a long time to be in the Pro long legal battle it at what point in time but doesn't become so absorbed that the court throws it out. So it just happen now, it's actually a new rule that as of February 2018 any lawsuit that hasn't been scheduled for for trial was administratively dismissed as a new law. And so But that doesn't affect mine. Unfortunately because we actually fought to get a case management judge on our case be on my case because I can set riemann's acting the fool. I can't seem to get in front of a judge everything's joke now. So we went one that I got to take the crazy thing about these lawsuits and I see now of course 2018 court cost me. So for instance. I need to find a motion against Marineland. It costs me $7,500. The judge says, okay Phil wins this round. Let's give them some money back in a partial Indemnity. He gets 3500 box back. Does it cost me for Grand Prairie lands on her mrs. An examination as an example. I've got to get what's called a certificate of non-attendance. I got to send a lawyer 1200 bucks. And how long is funded now? I'll have a public go fund me. Of course. I've had several. How do people if they wanted to Annex. I'm sure a lot of people listening to this like fuck this man. I got to help this guy, got my documentary on there, which I'd like to A little bit. It's great to be had a chance to look at it. If you get if you manage to it's it's pretty it's good these kids from Ryerson University. Did it the brave kids and how I know it's a very effectively documentary is that Marineland didn't sue them they know the danger of this documentary. They know how powerful it is and they didn't sue him. That's how I know that this is powerful and so they decided that it's so good to have to leave it alone and just ignore it because if they sue them then it'll put attention to exactly and so they made a small statement say all this is Phil just doing what field does and it's funny because the writers and students turn on Tobago, but that's not true. Like we came to you that's what they actually want to do a 5-minute personal profile of me this and look what I just do a quick interview with a picture. That morning. I think I'm in the right day. I just you know, we spoke for hours and then they should have called back and said, you know we want to do like maybe something more with this unless you guys do whatever the hell you want an open book give everything away. You want something here go go dots with it. And so they did and they did something great. It's really good and definitely definitely please check that out and we'll do it every time I talk to you. I'm happy to talk to your great guy, but I always get a fucking hugely depressed. I'm always just like what fucking now the volume if I have to get into my own personal well-being. Can you get compromised when things like this happen you do you just do I imagine? It's a half a decade of stress like big portion. I'm turning 40 in the months from 3543 Alban stress and loss it everyday and not just that they're sending balloons to my house. I mean, they sent the police to my house. I mean, it really is Relentless. 
========,9,title.
It's absurd to think that I want to mention his name because he deleted the tweet that it and he told me all Twitter deleted it cuz it's bullshit some attention but Peter had tweeted something and so he quoted that tweet said trying to burn this place is chlamydia very funny. I click retweet. I got the police cyber crimes unit on my front door the next day because the lawyer sent them because I decided violence for the followers, and I'm really I was worried that the the building is going to be burnt down. Why would never say to do that? Me neither fuck man, or I would never tell anyone to fly drone over it either. Opportunity for million view YouTube hits. I don't do it. Don't do that. man, it's just you know that they're on the wrong side of history and not just Marineland, but all these places all these places like there's going to come a time a time in the future will people look back at this kind of captivity of these hyper-intelligent social animals stolen from their families. It's a terrible terrible. Statement about human beings the thing I love about I guess what you come my campaign is that I have support from Hunters. I have support from veganzyme across the Spectrum on point. I had a far-right while person is proceed to the far right side internet personality sweet my documentary and then Rosie O'Donnell tweets and she's just left as guess. So yeah, thank you so much for the money when you spoil me with those UFC tickets. It's always the most timely thing and so appreciate it because it's just like this trip. It's exactly what I need at the time to start keep myself celebrate have some fun. And so I was going to New York City and I say you're messing like that and you like bro. Enjoy all night. And so so Rosy sees the documentary and some excessively a rose is Tweety documentary. So I go to Twitter and then I'll shut so I follow through follows me back. She said you'd like. It's really powerful like I really liked and if she goes to elaborate like I want to know more about you and I call you tomorrow Rosie's. I don't know what these days of kids no rose. You think Rosie O'Donnell was like, you know, I don't know these think I'm going to I'm going to LA tomorrow and imma call you back on Friday meeting with this Emmy Award for duesing producer and working to get this thing out there. And then she starts the same. This is what my heart still ache is that you know, you always Sort of hope that there's going to be a hero after that. I mean, especially the last five years has let's do this and especially in the case of with my walrus. She starts saying I think we Get the walrus like we can get some pressure get a TV network pressures on the skip that walrus. I'm just like you would you pull it on my fucking Hart Street. 
========,9,title.
And then I went to New York. I'd hoped to have lunch with Rosie on that pic of the trip. I was gone for two reasons actually has also was hoping to do some looking to get a reset without the intention of going to the New York. And then since that is just been radio Silence from Rosie. Unfortunately, and I accept that in that actions as complicated world and what not. But then she pulled on my heartstrings. I see how crazy is a lot of family issues and getting all sorts of other stuff too. But yeah, that's a bummer. Just a bummer is what it is. I think I also people get involved with you and hear the stories and then they get scared of being sued them sell a time that you should see it. I mean I just even last week I contact to someone that's the media now and my it's a very different landscape now from 2012 2012 media was against me corporate media was in the back pocket. Does the for Blackfish 2013/2014 715 media is mine 2016-17 18 now the media is just what the fuck they're doing that like it's all over the map. So it's hard to get any sort of like at Marineland will sue them so it's also an issue of after things have been going on for so long and nothing's happened. People start going. Well. What what can I do? A lot of people actually think relax. There's like to congratulate Dead really know that's still happening still being sued. It's all happening. It's just less current account and it's five years, but that's exactly they're there. That's what they're doing that subjective. Why is Lent 40 get tired of hearing about I'm tired of trying what's I think also that the 11 different counts of animal abuse and they probably fought like all this is it I know I thought that was it and then turn around and Sue the OSPCA which I mean. Then it's all dark man. It's it's really dark in the fact that so many people involved helping it feels dark, you know, it feels total violation of my life, like whatever I'm up for it. I'm here to fight but it feels gross every turn being like fucked up and all you can do all I can do in a lot of times. I'm not allowed to even speak of it never even compromised things in this find out tomorrow or Monday when I get up the whole Deluge of fucking legal threats, like I've been threatened with more lawsuits Marineland lawyers have in fact threatened. Other whistleblowers lawyers, so they're ready to sue lawyers. I mean to talk about coming up a system. It's over at that point. The lawyer sues another lawyer you looking at fifteen twenty fucking years was there changes in the laws in Canada? Like how you can sue people said there was a lot legislation that was enacted years ago. I spoke its Queens Park a bus or something that you were a source of course and then slap stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation. So I speak out against what's happening at Marineland Marineland of Malta Capital Corporation sues the shit out of me. I strategic way to try to silence you write Ontario passed legislation to make that illegal however at the time Pancheros Premier was suing the leader of the opposition. She took out the Retro Claus. So it was no longer a retroactive to any lawsuits that are already in the system. So now I'm actually fighting against a lawsuit that is illegal. And if it were to be applied to my lawsuit had it been Marine, I would be up against them. Of Damages like crazy just my fault of launching of a malicious because it's because when I sit back and and I just continue to eat it than other people actually I see in the paper once I go this Corporation try to see this girl's they owe her half a $9 for somebody for having lost the suit and I'm just like, oh my God damn man, I feel for you.

It's like I got no stock converted by the apartments into an Airbnb in honor of my cat that we spoke of in fact two years ago Eugene, so it's called the Eugene and so, you know, that's that's a means to sort of an occasionally at work for for Canada Post as a mailman, which I assume of love in that it challenges me everyday. I wake up in - 20 degrees when pollen blowing snow like crazy. I got a coat spend like 6 8 hours walking in this shit. It sucks, but That's Challenge and you got to wake up and rise to it. Right? I mean you could just as well stay in bed all day, but that's how I can help me. That's a weird thing about like mail delivery in a lot of places. It's still walking around all I do it. It's brutal, but I love it. I'm walking 20K a day do that lost a lot of weight. I'm feeling good. It's how it helps me. It really doesn't I need I need my body moving. I don't want speed fast and I'm 40. I'm slowing a little bit. Not that much surprisingly. I hope hopefully my run last for a while, but it helps me but the voice in my head goes from dude. Everything's abysmal and fucked to do you got this man stick with it. You got this getting powerfully Feeling Good by it's just right for me.

It really is in a perfect world where would you like all this to end I want the walrus sounds crazy. My dream is I'm going to free Wales. There's going to be a sanctuary Winfrey Marineland. Whales have a hand in this that's going to happen number. She really think that's going to happen. You think they're going to enact legislation that makes them release those animals. I think so. Yes really makes you so hopefully last two or three really tried to kill this bill for years. Now. They've not been able to him this time next week at the soccer should go that well Sanctuary Sanctuary project. They're going to build a whale Sanctuary this going to be a place for Wales. If it's in Canada and all the exportation laws are that real and can't get rid of their Wales. There will only be one place for Wales if that business he likes to evolve or if there's any type of ownership changes. I see this being a big ceiling to me how this Sanctuary would work. Well you have an environment where is append off in the ocean and you know the time in various different pens for various different procedures if you will, but the idea is that if they can't be holding released, then you got a place where they have a sense of semblance of of a freedom if you were but it'll be in human care. They'll be more of like for instance if viewing platform will people be able to view the whales versus of an area we talked about massive. Because nothing's finalized. So we're still under development. Would they develop a bae or something with a ideally get a baby that has good water change over let you know that that works if you can find that and I'm in the east coast is looking really good these days. Is there a model that they've drawn up not tons of different things. I just don't know how they're keeping the orcas in those things that you put a fence up and it wouldn't jump the fence that they don't do something about jumping out. I mean when the when the wild captured happen is it when we got here there's a way of saying we're building a model Sanctuary were captive whales and dolphins Cannery rehabilitated and live permanently in their natural environment. So it's a step. So this is a step between Des and then the the wild. Yes. No they going to free them and then release fish in there for them to eat. I imagine they'll be all of that every witch way. So nice to Allow them to actually hunt and kill the fish, which I'm sure that's what they want to do. The fact that they can feel the natural rhythms of the CNE there in tune with the Sierra in their environment of the pools. No place what it says here. 4 medium served four years median survival time in years for wild-caught workers at a marine park for years 1100 square yards of space in a large display tank in a typical high in Marine tank. 314600 is a minimum number of square yards for the first whale Sanctuary project Seaside Sanctuary. So this is 314600 square yards will be a massive place. 105 is the number of captive orcas and belugas North America. So that includes Marine Lansing Marineland has half the belugas in North America is crazy. It's crazy and they fly under the radar because no one wants to talk about him, right 24/7 round-the-clock care care for the whales the sanctuary that sounds beautiful realize threaten to sue these people be talking. I am not song by me more than just you seems like fuck man people listening please get involved. This is a great step though. I love this idea of this stop. You know, what like have something that's like a bridge between the captive in the wild. Also it would allow their atrophied Dorsal fins to it to reinvigorate event. They can start diving deep again. I mean, I don't know how deep in this early but at least a little bit and get you could train these animals to physically take them for walks if you like us to come swims where you want me to leave. I'm just follow both go for some extra so you can totally do I mean really the things that this is going to present the opportunities for these animals is really been amazing and the board is comprised of all your all your wild animal brilliant scientist. I mean, this is the project this is the future. So that is the way to do it. Right? Cuz I've always said when you go to a place like SeaWorld or whatever and you look at all those dolphins and killer whales like, how would you get them free? How'd it do it have to be some intermediary step. There it is. Wow, that's exciting times mad. If I hope they do that man. They do that cuz I feel like it was a place we could go and people could feed the killer whales like release some fish or something like that and be there to watch that would be way more exciting than watching them in a swimming pool. Watch a fucking killer whale fart in a while vs. Do a backflip in the Captivity and you're watching that fart in our and the in this thing is just music and bullshit.

I pulled over yesterday morning. I was in Malibu real early in the morning and I'll pull over watch some Dolphins was awesome. I was told I was speaking with someone they like their Malibu calcium together here right now. I was I was on the PCH and I was driving into the corner of my eye. I saw something in the water and then I saw that the tail is going over in a few of them together and I pulled over to Mike focht man. That's amazing, but I don't want to live in Malibu some scared tsunamis. But if you were there like right there like looking out your fucking bedroom window and check. First thing in the morning with dolphins in your yard, and they're just wild man having a good old time. They just feel different. You know, you see them in Marineland or or I've never seen a Marineland but you see him in any sort of captive area and you just get this weird feeling like Heather cool to look at but man it just not there just not that you'd you know, there's something missing their that's like the difference between seeing a cow in a pan versus a buffalo in the wild, you know, just this is where Hunters I say. They're really this is where I get a lot of support from Hunters Hunters what are depressed you are in 1/2 hour watching a minute when it's horrible another alarm they'll of wild animals. They love things to be wild now. It's just it's just a very depressing aspect of human nature that we chose to go down this route and that we did a long time ago. I really truly believe that if there was no dolphin and orca captivity ever previously before it would not be possible to do today and possibly I would freak out there was at least in America Futures Brandon kids are schools and every kid the beautiful thing. I mean, it sounds horrible, but the kids that go to Marine I get singled out pretty bad by the other kids. So it's not a good time to bring the kids to do a place like Maria unless you want to get your kids. What about China? How was it? How was it? So cool in China? They just don't get it over there. They just don't know that everything furniture for sure, I just know that that's That'll be there for a while yet. Right the Paradigm Shift hasn't taken there yet, man. I'll be awhile.

And if it doesn't make you crack up but doesn't make you cry. It doesn't make you really sad that people are capable of doing that. It's just it's just wrong. It's just it's not it's not what we should be doing as a as a as a species as were raised as a civilization. It's just the wrong thing to do and one day it will be looked upon very very poorly.
