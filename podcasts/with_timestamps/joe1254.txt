5 4 3 2 1 is it hanging up on me? Well, I've live. Dr. Phil. Well, I've someone's calling you it's going on there's people have with people. I was trying to find now there's a little shit you'll let him worry, um out of all the years you've been doing your show and all the years you've been given advice. How how did this catch me outside girl. How did this happen at all the all the different shows you made a monster. I know I mean, it's my moment of infamy. Seriously. This girl comes on with her mother and her mother actually brings her on a course and she's a train wreck and we work with her and we send her to this Ranch for like four months, right? She goes for a long time and makes a complete turnaround does a Grilli a great job. They say she's become a leader. She's working with all these girls doing a great job and then she graduates and I remember this last shot when we do this this piece at the ranch. She jumps up on this fence and is smiling and everything and waving it all one night home with her mother one night and her mother's finding people that are trashing her the mother on on the social media platforms, her mother tracks him down backs into who they are gets their phone numbers calls him up yelling into the phone calling him names and stuff gets the daughter involved one night crashes. So they come back for a follow-up. Like I don't know month or two later and when they come I say, okay, we're going to have him back they walk out. I have the audience completely empty. I have nobody there to play too. I mean 250 Here's empty nobody in the house, but me the mother and the daughter that's a good move. And they go what where is everybody else? Will you don't need anybody? We're just here to talk and you know keep things rolling, right and they were dumbstruck. They there was nobody there to showboat for or play too. And there's like a 15-minute interview. They had nothing to say and off they go and then this phrase that got turned into a you know, whatever a meme or whatever they call it. Yeah, it just went crazy and what she was nominated for a Grammy or something Sherry. I'm serious. So I'm I take no credit or blame. You know, I just did what I could and him senior saying I wish everybody. Well, maybe she'll turn some maybe it'll grow up. She'll turn some pasta, but I hope so. Well, that's a very good attitude very healthy attitude for you, but it is When something goes viral like that something strange that for whatever reason it catches and takes off its it doesn't make any sense. It's very weird thing. It makes no sense. She's on a billboard on Sunset a giant billboard really huge enormous billboard. It's like one of those side of the building billboards with a the you know, they put the graphic up and covers the entire building. It makes no sense. Seriously seriously, and there's people curing cancer. You can't find him with both hands. Exactly. Nobody has any idea who won the last Nobel Prize for exactly but you know, you know more power to her eye if she can turn into something positive. Does she have talent if you ever heard any of her music now, I've no idea. I've only seen her on your show. Thanks, man. I appreciate you bringing that up, but it's just so strange that one train wreck could for whatever reason catch on and then all of a sudden it's gigantic. They say that somebody signed her and paid her millions of dollars. Seriously that she got like a close to a million dollars from a Makeup Company. Really? Yeah. Oh well, okay. There you go. I mean if that's happening, right? Like what would your advice be then? Would your advice be? Hey get your shit together and stop being crazy. Well, she's making a lot of money off of being crazy and her opportunities before that were probably severely limited. Well, they had to be and what I hope now that this even though this certainly is a quirk what I hope now is that she's surrounded by mature people with business heads on their shoulders and development people that will actually guide this in a way that it's not 15 minutes, right? Yeah, the never know, you know, that's what I hope. Well everybody thought the Kardashians we're going to be 15 minutes. It's been 15 years. Yeah, but there's been you know, people make fun of them and there's some good things there to make fun of they do things to be made fun of but there's also from very smart. Listen branding that's gone into that as well a hundred percent and you know and I was actually very impressed with her that she actually went to the White House to talk about prison reform right for people that are unjustly accused and are being been in jail for too long for things that they didn't do and that's something she's actually passionate about. Yeah, and I know Kim and she's actually a very nice girl very smart and all in, you know, they as I say they've done some very brilliant branding and it certainly paid off just so fascinating when something catches like that girl. What is your name? The catch me? I saw a girl Danielle Brooke goalie or something. Yeah some more shit. Yeah, because I didn't know where is to catch me outside girl, but if she didn't say that one phrase, yeah, and she just said that I think to her grandmother or somebody in the audience. I know you didn't even register with us at the time. Wow. We did it was it wasn't a standout phrase in the interview or anything. It just passed by somebody just grabbed it and Then it became a meme. Yeah, what a weird world. We live in yeah, no kidding. What is it? 
========,9,title.
I mean it has to be a lot of responsibility to try to give people advice and try to straighten their life out and show them the flaws and errors that they're making. Yeah it is, you know, people ask me sometimes they say, you know doc filled our problems you think problems are as simple as you make him out to be and the truth is I don't think problems are simple at all. In fact, I think problems are really most of the time pretty complex pretty layered. They have a lot of different Origins and they're often times comorbid a lot of things exist together. So I don't think problems are simple at all. But two solutions are often simple, don't you think I mean, it's kinda like the old joke, you know the doctor and you say this hurts and he said well then don't do that anymore. Yeah. It's a lot. Times it's very simple in it. Somebody will have a complex thing that comes from childhood or maybe it's a drug background or they've had trauma in their life. But the solution is change your behavior. I mean stop rewarding bad behavior choose a different path in life. Just Behavior way to success. Sometimes the solutions are very simple, even though the problems are very complex because at some point you have to stop focusing on fly and start focusing on what instead of why it happened. What am I going to do to change it? So sometimes the solutions are pretty simple but implementing those Solutions are often very it's often very difficult for people to change their lives change their patterns. It is in in patterns is the key. Nobody does anything in pattern if they don't get a payoff. And if you can identify that's why that's why inside so important. That's why I think it's the number one outcome to whether somebody's going to respond to a talking therapy. For example, if somebody can identify what their payoff is where they really can figure out I'm doing this repeatedly and my payoff is I don't have to work or I don't get held accountable for this or I'm escaping accountability over here or I get attention or sympathy or if they can figure out what their payoff is and they can then control that whether it's for themselves or their kids or whatever if you control the currency, then you can control the behavior. Hmm. Yeah. It's it just seems that people have they have this comfort in their patterns and even if their patterns are self destructive events drug abuse or alcoholism or it did those those the comfort in those patterns falling into those. Patterns. It seems very compelling to a lot of people. Yeah and payoffs don't necessarily mean that it's a positive payoff, right? I mean payoff for taking heroin as you get high and so your high for a while that's not a positive payoff, but it's a payoff wrap and if you if you get high and so you don't get a job and you don't take care of your kids. That's a payoff that you're not doing things that you need to do that you should be accountable for its a pathological payoff but is a payoff nonetheless. And so that does reward you even though it's a pathological payoff. It's a pathological thing you call it a reward and if you but if you can identify that where they say, look I'm I'm not doing what I need to do and I need to stop rewarding myself in that way and hold myself accountable to be there for my kid. I tell my kid. I'm going to be there every day and I don't show up because I'm high on drugs then, you know, I need to stop doing I don't need I need to not let myself get away with that and instead require myself to show up for the kid when I say I do say I will and then you see what's in the kids eyes you share the experience with them now that becomes your payoff. So then you'll start showing up for your kid. Yeah. How many people take your advice how many people just listened and try for a little bit and then bail, you know, it's hard to say because I think are sometimes our most productive guests are the ones that don't get it because the mail we get they'll say, oh, wow, that guy didn't get her to that woman do get it but I saw myself in them and I'll never say that again. Mmm. I saw them being such a right fighter or I saw them being so hard-headed or so oppositional and I see I heard them say things I've said and they left and didn't get it. I got it. I'll never do that again. So sometimes those that don't get it at all while they're there are the ones that are the best teaching tools for the millions of people that are home watching. Yeah. That's interesting. Isn't it? When you watch people fail and you go okay, I see that in myself. Yeah. I just got to not do what that guy is doing. And also do you see the stubborn pigheadedness that some people have when they won't listen to advice and you could Really see how they're ruining their lives by not being honest and sometimes the story that we might have is maybe extreme where you say, I don't do all six things they're doing but I do two of them and they are in sharp relief to me. So I get that I'm going to do that anymore. So, I mean that's where I think you get a payoff and you know people go and find these things on the internet. I mean last year, we have a channel that we put up different clips from divorce shows our parenting shows or whatever and we had over two billion views, you know last year people just going and finding out information and looking at it. So I know people are seeking the information out and looking at beyond the show itself. Oh, you know, they must be seeking information and we just don't have a good distribution system for mental health in America. So I think they look I think they're hungry for it and they look for it.

Well, there's so many people out there that are trying to Do better the trying to get their lives in order and you know shows like yours and and you know, just advise shows people that are giving out inspiration and knowledge. It's so it's such a an important thing for people especially for people that didn't grow up with wise parents or maybe a good support system around them. You know, I think that's that's true and you know, I grew up with a alcoholic father and it was a pretty violent home and and he was a really bad alcoholic and I know having grown up in that you wind up with what I call a damaged personal truth and you feel second class and the problem that kids make and because I know I did it and and I see others do it is you compare your personal truth what you know about Yourself and you know how you really live and what's really going on you compare your personal truth to everybody else's social mask because you go to school and you know, well, I know that last night the windows got kicked out of my house. I know that the utilities got turned off and I know there was a big fight in my kitchen last night and the kids sitting next to me. He's got on a shirt that's all ironed and his face is all bright and clean and you know, he looks like he's just got it all together and you compare yourself to that person that kid and you feel like your second class and the problem with that is we generate the results in life. We think we deserve So if you think your damn knees, do you think your second class you will generate? Results that you think a second class person deserves. Hmm. So if you don't fix your personal truth, then you'll spend the rest of your life saying well, you know, those really good results those belong for somebody else. That's not for me that's for somebody else and you'll settle for second best and you won't get what you might otherwise generate for yourself if you don't fix your personal truth, And so I think a lot of people are struggling looking for a way to kind of get out of feeling not good about themselves and damaged self-esteem damage self-worth and they really don't know where to go. So and that's why I do the show. I don't look I'm not into the misapprehension that we're doing eight minute cures up there. I mean come on, we're not doing that. But I think if you can point people in the right direction, if you can raise their awareness, you can get them thinking about it. You can create a narrative where they at least say, you know, how do I feel about myself? I mean is there stuff I need to resolve. I mean what am I saying to myself you can get them thinking about that then, you know, maybe you've done something.

Yeah, you know, Tony Robbins wants said once said it's incremental changes over the Long Haul and the way you have to look at it as if these two boats are going in a parallel Direction and one of them just shifts five degrees over the course of time. This boat is going to be in a far different place than the other boat that's going the same way. It was always going The important thing to realize is well is the next year's going to go by whether you're doing something about your life or not. I mean we're sitting here right now at the end of February and the next 10 months are going to go by whether somebody is working to make change or whether they're not and they may think you know, oh my God, I'm so far away and I'll never get it under control or I'm so behind in my bills or I'm so you know just depressed or my everything is so out of control. Well, you know what you make those incremental changes and then, you know pretty soon in December you go. Hey, I'm way better off and I was at the end of February. So should we you made little changes and they all added up and if you don't by the end of the year, you're just in deeper, so every little bit matters. Yeah. I tell people to write things down. I said one of the best ways to get things done is to write things down. Write down what you trying to get done write down what you need to get done on a long-term basis and what you need to get done on a short-term basis right off a checklist force yourself be countable. Yeah, the difference between a dream and a goal is a timeline and accountability. Yeah, accountability is gigantic. You got to have somebody it whether it's yourself or a friend or somebody that's going to say look. Did you do what you said you were going to do by this time? And if you don't hold your feet to the fire because I mean just sitting around dreaming someday, you know, someday, I'm going to get a different job. Someday. I'm going to change this will some day any day of the week. Yeah, there's money Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday Sunday. Look on your counter some days not on there. So you got to say okay. I'm going to take this small step by here this small step by their this small step by there and then pretty soon, you know, we don't leap tall buildings in a single bound. We take it a floor at a time now Matt over all the years. You've been doing your show. You've developed a real Community, right? I mean you really have made an impact if you stop and think about all the people that your shows and touched and all the people that have listened to your advice and all the people that have taken that advice and and made those little incremental changes in their lives and set those goals and held themselves accountable and that's a pretty significant thing.

Well, I hope so, I mean, I think I know that There's a stigma attached to mental illness and that really bothers me. There should not be I mean having depression or anxiety or whatever to me should have no more stigma than having a knee injury or kidney infection or diabetes, but there is yeah the stigma attached to it and I've tried to talk about this in a way where it's okay to talk about it and not be ashamed of it. It's okay. You've got anxiety. You got PTSD whatever it's okay. Let's talk about it. Let's get help for it. Get it behind you and move on. I mean just not it's not something that you should be ashamed of. What do you when you talking to someone that maybe has depression do you try to get them to exercise first? You try to get them to visit a psychiatrist immediately and get on medication. Like do you take it on a case-by-case basis? Well, I do but you have to approach it. Everybody has a philosophy about it. And I'm not saying that mine's any better than anybody else's but I do have a philosophy about it and I'm very slow to medication. I mean, I think you I think you use medication for biochemical replacement. I mean, if for some reason your body is not making enough of something it needs then maybe you support it short-term biochemically, but you know, I I look at depression like there's a lot of ways you can break it up, but I look at it. Like is it exogenous depression or in dodging this depression? I mean, is it coming from the inside out or the outside in is it because you're reacting to something? I see a lot of depressed people that In a sense. It makes sense. Right? I mean you look at their life and you say well if you're not down about this, you should be I mean, you've lost your job. You've gotten a divorce your health is in the shitter your I mean you should be down about this. It's external things. So you don't need a pill I mean put somebody in a chemical straitjacket because their life's falling apart what the hell's that going to do? Yeah, but that's just putting goggles on them where they can't see it. I would much rather get them to behave their way to success and say what are you reacting to that you're depressed about? Let's put that on a to-do list and start like you said write it down and start Crossing those things off. Let's figure what's an action plan to change this action plan to change the next thing actually and then when you start doing that then you generally see their mood lift. A lot of people that are depressed or just realistic. Italy reacting to a crummy circumstance in their life. It's not necessarily a mental illness. It's just a really realistic reaction to a bad spot in their life. Yeah, that's such a weight good way of putting it to that. You weren't in a bad State looking at this might be something wrong with you you're in denial is yeah. I mean if if you've got a divorce lost your job your health in bad shape your kids are alienated from you and you're saying I'm fine, then you're not in touch with reality, right? You should be bothered by that and and I think to give somebody a pill to mask your feelings about that just keeps you off task. I don't you pains a good motivator, you know, I grew up in like, Texas and Oklahoma Then I don't know you've ever done this but we were I used to spend my summers in the thriving Metropolis of Monday Texas you ever heard of Monday, Texas? No, it's mu n it's a you not an OM UND a why it's got like two thousand people in it. But in the Summers it would get hot in Monday Texas when I say hot. I mean you look out in the backyard and your dog burst into flames is what I'm about so we would be going to the swimming pool or something barefooted and you get halfway across an asphalt road and you look down and you're I mean like, holy shit me your feet are just on fire. So what are you going to do? I mean that is painful you're going to do one or two things. You're either going to make a U-turn and get your ass back over to the side of the road and getting the grass or you're going to run to the other side and get off the road and getting the grass, but you're not To stand there in the middle of the road and melt yourself down to the knees pain is a motivator pain is not necessarily always bad. If you're in pain, it's going to motivate you to move to change something and to match that with drugs to dull that pain with drugs is not necessarily a good thing. That is Wise Wise advice and I wish more people thought that way particularly more doctors, you know, I have so many friends that have gone to a doctor because I'm not feeling so good and they're almost immediately wanting to throw them on something. 
========,9,title.
Yeah, but not smart in all the years you've been doing this have you noticed like was depression as prevalent like the term depression or was it doesn't I mean, I don't really remember it being a thing when I was a kid that was discussed the way it's discussed now now it's discussed the way people discuss all sorts of other ailments. Is it just an awareness thing or is it just people are thinking about it now in different terms. Well, I think it's part of the narrative. Now and I think with social media with the internet not just social media with the internet. I think there's just a lot more. It's a lot more in the nomenclature and there's a lot more awareness about it. But I think it was just as prevalent in the 50s and 60s as it was now but in the 50s and 60s, there wasn't a psychologist on every corner, right and there is now yeah, and there wasn't sub doctoral licensing then I mean you what does that mean? Well back then you had to have a PhD or an MD is a psychiatrist to see patients. Now, they have marriage and family therapist and a licensed social workers. They have different levels where you can do independent practice. So that's broadened. The number of people that can provide services and some people think that's a good thing. Some people think it's not I generally think it's a it's a good thing because I think 58% of our rural markets today have no psychiatrist available and something like 50 or roughly have no mental health professional available at all none. So there's just nobody available to help people in in the outlying areas. So I think the more people you can get into the profession so long as there's a degree of Competency is better, but you know, I think it's always been prevalent. I just think people didn't talk about it very much. There's just something I swallowed or they took the church or yeah, you know, when you see, you know, these all these folks that are on medication today. I mean how many of these people do you think legitimately should be on medication? I mean, is it something you can assess? You know, I can't answer that in terms. I'm sure there's research of People how many people are on medication but in my personal experience most of the people that I see on medications in my opinion don't need most of the medications they're on now and that's just anecdotal as my opinion. You asked me to hand you a research survey or study to support that I can't hand it to you or I can't point you to one. I just tell you after 45 years in this experience. I see people that are on medication. They've usually seen someone for six or eight minutes. And said, you know, I'm really feeling kind of down a group. Yep. Here's some Prozac. Here's this here's that they give it to them and they don't even really asked. Well why and they just give it to him because medicine has become a high-volume business and that's not necessarily the doctors fault. I mean the way that it's now funded and Medicare and Medicaid you got to turn them and burn them and yeah, or you can't stay in business and so it's a high-volume business and so they throw pills out them because they don't have an hour to sit down or don't take an hour to sit down and talk about and say well let's find out what's going on. Is there a reason like I said, if this guy's got five parts of his life that have gone down or a woman has got you know, three or four areas of her life that have really gone down in quality, then they should be having poor mood. So why mask that let's come up with an action plan and change it. So most of People I see on medication not all but most of the people I see are on too many medications into high dose or either don't need it at all. And I'm really bothered by polypharmacy. That's where I really get frustrated. Yeah. This is what you're saying is a very common-sense approach but it's not the norm today. No, it seems like more people are treating this, you know, air quotes depression issue is if it's a medical disorder like like diabetes or something when you need medication. Yeah and look for a lot of people that works. I mean, yeah, you give people a mood elevator and they say hey I feel better and then maybe they changed their life. Maybe they move their life into a more positive direction. They can wean themselves off of it because one of the things about depression for example using as an example is you get what's referred to as psychomotor retardation. There's a there's a lessening in activity level. And I think old sayings get to be old sayings because her profound like you're not going to get ahead of you're not swinging. Well if you're depressed and so you think slower less actively you behave less actively your chance of getting rewarded goes down, right you don't get out there and you don't mix it up socially as much you don't apply for jobs as much you're not as productive on your job as much so you're less likely to get strokes. You less likely to get rewarded. Well, maybe you go take a pill and it lifts your mood up so you get more active. And so now you can start getting Pat's on the back you start getting people to engage with you more so that lifts your mood and set takes care of it. So you took the medication short-term your lifted back up in your okay short term, it can be an alternative. But I've seen people on everything from opioids to mood elevators for years. And that's where you lose me. Yes, don't get it. Yeah. I know people that have been on things since they were five years old. Yeah, they're in their 40s. Yeah, and then you have wastebasket diagnosis like ADD and ADHD where you know, what used to be a spoiled brat is now add or ADHD. So they start prescribing these Ritalin neocortical stimulants like Ritalin and if you give a kid that does not need a neocortical stimulant a stimulant. You're really gonna throw em off the charts now because your you've got a normally active brain that you're now making hyperactive. So you're creating a problem that didn't exist before you gave me medication because you didn't do the proper diagnosis. Yeah. I had my old neighbor had a situation like that. They had a kid and the kid was just had a lot of energy and they weren't paying attention to them. And so they started medicating them. It's insanely common. Yeah, and you cannot chemically babysit your children and who knows where these kids are going to be 20 30 years from now. I mean, we're just looking at either this rash of people being treated for these ailments are quotes and then we're not seeing how this all turns out in the long run and how much damage were doing to these people know In fairness on the other end of the Continuum. I have seen some people that are clearly psychotic schizophrenic 6 delusional that without Medication are absolutely impossible to manage. But if you put them on antipsychotics and so you can lower their delusional Behavior their hallucinatory behavior so you can now have a meaningful conversation with them so they can respond to talking therapies. It makes all the difference in the world. And without those antipsychotics. You would be lost. Yeah without them. So there are some medications for some disorders that are absolute Miracles that without them you wouldn't be able to do the work you need to do to get the person back where they need to be. Yeah unquestionably. I mean, there's definitely a lot of great pharmaceutical drugs it helped a lot of people do you get pushback from a lot of these positions from the established medical community, you know sometimes but you know mostly when you talk to people about it thoughtfully. They agree with with what I'm saying. I mean most people will agree that you need to be thoughtful about prescribing medications and that medications are too readily administered. I mean, that's certainly what we've seen in the opioid epidemic right now opioids are so readily prescribed right now that there are enough opioid prescriptions for every man woman and child in America to have their own bottle. And if you renew that prescription one time. One time if you are taking those opioids at the seven-day Mark your chance of being addicted at one year is one in 12 and if you renew it at if you're still taking 30 days, your likelihood of being addicted is one in three. Wow. And these things are getting written with way too high a pill count and it's and so the addictions we're seeing a whole different kind of addiction now coming out of the suburbs and they take them for a while and they're very expensive. And after you take them for a while heroin is cheaper. So they dumped the opioids and start taking the heroin. So you're seeing soccer mom heroin addicts that you weren't seeing 10 years ago because they get started on prescription opioids and then the can't afford them or finally the doctor Cuts them off but they're addicted and so they start taking heroin because it's cheaper. Now. This is obviously a very disturbing pattern but where does she is going like when you look at the future and mean it looks bleak in that regard? I mean, I've known several people that have had real problems with pills. Yeah the problem that that I think people have is they think because a doctor gave me this because it's on a Prescription Pad that This is safe. Your body doesn't know whether you got that in the back alley or you got it from a doctor. It still has the same addictive quality and I think it is at an epidemic level and I've testified before Congress about this and I think there are several levels of accountability at the manufacturing level and at the prescription level and at the educational level so people understand I think everybody has to take part of it and I'm doing everything I can to raise the awareness about it as well. When you testify before Congress. What was the reaction they're very much aware that this has become a serious serious problem because the cost as you see the Lost labor in the workforce is in the billions of dollars. You see the the demands on the Health Care system that this is creating Young mothers with with children and babies born addicted to these opioids. I mean the numbers are just going through the roof. So I mean it's putting a strain financially on the Health Care system that it just can't stand so you start costing money and it starts getting politicians attention. So they start saying okay now we got to start doing something so they get it they get that there's a problem. What could they do though? Once the music once that Genies out of the bottle? 
========,9,title.
Well clearly you've got to start educating people and the manufacturers have to be required to start labeling this much more clearly Physicians have to be much more conservative in prescribing. You know, I just had this shoulder surgery and I took like one one opioid one pill they gave me in the hospital and after that you can manage it with like Tylenol or something because the surgeons now are so good with the arthroscopic surgeries and stuff. It's so much less of an insult to the body that with ice and Tylenol. So if you can manage it if you just kind of focus on it a little bit and I'm not saying if you've had surgery and you're having organic pain, For god sakes get ahead of the pain and stay ahead. But when you as soon as you can get off of it get off of it and understand what's happening. Yeah, there's no sense being like Macho be don't need a leather strap between your teeth and go have surgery. I mean shit if it hurts take the pill get past it but realized the minute you can get away from that you need to get away from it. But you know, they don't need to give you a 30 day supply right? They need to give you three or four days and then you got to go see your doctor again if it's still a problem discuss it I mean, that's what that's what I think needs to happen to just be a lot more conservative about what you're giving is a promise these pharmaceutical companies make so much money. Yes, they don't want to they don't want to back off that they got private jets and Yachts to pay for. Yeah, they're starting to shut down some of these they had some of these pill clinics in pain clinics in Florida where you could go in without an x-ray without an MRI and just say you had back pain and there was a doctor there that would give you a nine account. And on the spot no questions asked 90. Hmm and you're out the door and you go down the street to the next one. Yeah, because there was no database no database and that doctor might be a foreign doctor that flew in from offshore wrote all the prescriptions during the day flew off again at night and now they're shutting that stuff down. So the the Hammers coming down.

Well one can only hope when you've been doing your show as long as you've been doing it and I'm sure you you've made it a ton of loot. What makes you want to do a podcast. Why doing that well, my interest has been You're saying there are a lot of people getting their information on the internet. By getting clips of the show and that sort of thing and it's clear to me. That is the population is changing. You know, I'm an old guy but younger people are getting their information in different ways, you know the am going to the internet and the digital menu has got to be readily available and you can reach a lot of people that way that you wouldn't reach the other way. There's a whole population that's not going to watch broadcast television during the day. Yeah, and there's a whole population that's watching broadcast television during the day that maybe isn't on in the digital space and if I can get a crossover between the two and you can get a bigger audience to spread your message then you know, that's what you're doing up. My goal is to spread the message and get what I think's important to say out there. So I mean, I'll shout it from the rooftops if that's what I can if I think that's effective. I want to do anything that's scalable. To get the message out there and and to me I'm doing I'm doing some different things in the podcast and I'm doing on the show on the show. I've got a fact pattern in front of me. I've got a story. I got a family got an individual that's got a specific fact Paradigm dealing with that fact pattern in the podcast. I'm not solving a problem. I don't have somebody there. That has a problem for me to solve. I'm just talking to people that I find interesting and I'm able to talk to them about whatever I want to talk to him about and discuss things like you and I are talking about right now. I think this is I think what we've been talking about is an important discussion and I welcome the opportunity to have that discussion and I don't have time to do that when I'm talking about somebody who's sitting there saying, you know, I think my kid is on the precipice of overdosing or is really in trouble and I got to focus on that. I don't have time to pontificate about such things as the opioid epidemic or the philosophy of pills versus therapy and things of that nature because I have to give all my attention to the story in front of me in the podcast environment like we're doing now I can talk about things that I think People need to hear I think it's if they don't they don't have to listen, but if they if they're interested it's there. So I like it being more freeform and me being able to talk about things like when talking about what makes people a champion like I talked to Tony Romo right after the Super Bowl about you came from Eastern, Illinois University is like what nine students or something? He's a little bitty University and he turns out to be Quarterback of America's team for 14 years set all kinds of records and then goes to the booth and becomes a number one color analyst in television mean champion champion champion you why you'll what is it? What do you attribute that to I like asking those questions. You hear people talk. What do you say to young people about that? What made you a champion? Are you going to let your kids play football with all this CTE and stuff. What do you say I'm out. I like having those kind of conversations to the same thing with Shaq and Charles Barkley and different people. What did he say about what makes you a champion? for him He said that. He has this. He says he didn't he wasn't the kind of swagger sort of person that you know came in cocky like he was gonna own the field and own the game. But inside he said he had this absolute drive that if he didn't win he couldn't live with it is like if somebody thought he played the game. Somebody beat them beat him that just the idea that that person went home thinking that they were better than him that they could beat him that he just couldn't eat sleep think until he got back and owned it again and got back to what he said. He just just drive to win and so he would mean he said he would be out at one o'clock in the morning in the dome throwing a pass that that route got intercepted. He got jumped on that route. And you be trying to figure out why on Thursday in practice. He saw what he needed to see why didn't he see it on Sunday? And he would analyze and analyze and analyze until he could get there until he could do it until he could win it. 
========,9,title.
He just had this drive to win that super unhealthy Obsession. They all share that Michael Jordan had that I mean we've talked about that several times on the podcast. So many people that are extreme winners. They're psychotic in their obsession with winning. Yeah, that's all they want to do. And if they lose they could they it's almost insufferable. They almost can't deal with it. Yeah, and I I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing. But the difference between winners and losers his winners. Do things losers do not want to do. Yeah, they will get up in the middle of the night. They will do this. They will do that. They feel it more. They just do things losers don't want to do that pay a price losers. Just don't want to pay. Yeah and loser say it's just not worth it. And every winter has been loser. Oh, that's what made him a winner. Yeah, if all you ever did if it's if you go through life is in a success only Journey. God how boring would that be me? You think it would be great but it's like eating ice cream every meal about the fourth meal. You're going to be thinking gosh. Let's kill something and eat it. Well, it's like we talking about about depression about that bad feelings will motivate you to change if you're in a bad feeling if you're if you're in a bad state in your life that pain is an amazing motivator and even though it feels terrible at the time it can Propel you to a new and better life because you don't ever want to experience that again and make you grow and be a better person. Yeah, and yeah and you got to decide what's your currency? I mean because you say, you know, you've done your show a long time and probably don't need the money, but there are different kinds of currency, right? I mean, you don't always work for one kind of currency. I mean every year when we wrap our season, I kind of take a month and let everybody go unwrap, you know, just kind of unwind and relax and kick back and do whatever they want to do and then we start meeting and focusing on. Okay, how can we reinvent ourselves for next season? How can we tell our stories better? How can we broaden our Horizons do things different so that we raise our game because we're kind of competing with ourselves. There's you know, we're kind of a category by ourselves with only one that does what we do and we've been number one for a long time because I got a really hard working team. But we're in a nobody else tries to do what we do. So we're kind of competing with ourselves. And so we work real hard to figure out. How can we have a bigger impact? How can we tell this more effectively what techniques can we come up with that make this even more powerful more impactful than what it is and that's what you know, that's what really gets me moving. Well, it's very telling it's been that's why I would imagine you move towards doing a podcast where it's less restrictive and more open-ended and you can kind of do whatever you want. 
========,9,title.
But it's that's pretty cool that after all these years of doing that and giving out advice you still find this this passion to to make it better and to do it from a different angle. Yeah, and you know, I'm as excited about we're just about to wrap, you know are 17 season 17 seasons and that's a lot. Hey, how many episodes you done coming up on three thousand and I did Oprah for five years before cool. And so that's that's 22 years and then your watch and then I just renewed for five years renewed out to 2023 if you ever take before you sign that like what am I doing? Well, let's go fishing. Yeah, Robin and I thought about it, but well, what am I going to do? I mean, I don't you know, I don't want well you enjoy it obvious I do. Yeah. I enjoy it you could tell and you know, I've always told my team the thing that we don't want I don't want to get bored. Right and if it gets formulaic for me, it'll be formulaic for the viewer and I don't want that to happen. And we do a lot of news stories and stuff and that keeps it fresh. Because you don't know what's going to break in the news tomorrow, right? And so we do most of the really big news stories and we don't break the news stories we go behind the headline talk about here's what really happened as Paul Harvey said, here's the rest of the story. Yeah. Yes what you read in the headline. Now, here's the here's the rest of the story and I really like doing that. I really like getting into that. Well, when you're doing this on your podcast one of the beautiful things about that is that you know, you can explore these ideas without commercial breaks. You don't have to have anybody telling you what to do. You could just whatever is interesting to you. Is that how you pick the subjects and the people that you're talking to? Yeah like this week. I had on Pam Myers who wrote lie spotting I spend a lot of money. Is that a book on Liars by spotting? Yeah, and I've spent a lot of my career on Deception detection because Spent a lot of time in the litigation Arena on interrogation techniques. That's how you met over right? Yeah. Yeah, that was when she was doing that. The beef industry was sooner. Yeah the Mad Cow case in Amarillo. Yeah. She got sued for a couple billion dollars and represented her in that case and that's how we met and taught me I had Pam on and we've both worked a lot in deception detection and interrogation techniques and stuff. And so just and it came right at a time when you know, jussie Smollett is in the news about you telling the truth was he not telling truth and then here we have this conversation about what did you think immediately when you heard that story? I was very suspicious when I heard that yeah, Jaime and I we shut the once the cameras are off like these off fuck that guy that you real that nobody did it was just too much like a movie. Yeah. It was a bad movie. Yeah. In its nine below zero and two people are lying in wait just in hopes that he might come by 2:00 a.m. Yeah, I mean so strange it was suspicious and you know, he's entitled to due process and he's going to get it. Yeah, he's gonna get it. Now. He's saying he has some untreated drug problem. 
========,9,title.
So he's trying to carve out some path to explain his bizarre behavior, but there are very there are very specific lie behaviors that people Can't really control like what kind of stuff well, for example. When when people are really desperately trying to convince you they're telling the truth, they'll do a lot of times what are called convincing statements rather than just telling you what they did or didn't do they'll do convincing statements. Like you know me like somebody saying who's somebody stole the petty cash in the office? I think you know me I give more my I donate more money than was stolen. You know, you guys know me. I mean, I was employed as if we Clash, you know, they're this convincing you that there's this nice guy and then they'll sound what someone does if the wrongly accused know, what does someone do if they're wrongly accused if the wrongly accused they'll look you straight up in the eye and tell you I didn't do it and if you ask them, what do you think should happen to somebody that did Are there some person will say I think they should be found. I think it should be held fully accountable to the extent of the law. Somebody that's guilty will say well, you know, I don't know. I mean people make mistakes and yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you got to give a guy a second chance. Do you worry that in coaching that you're essentially coaching Liars by telling people this kind of stuff and someone who does steal the money, you know would be able to kind of like, hey, it's not for amateurs. Yeah, and when you there were some things that you can tell people to watch for but one of the things you do if there's somebody that you suspect is you increase their cognitive load during the interrogation and there's no way you can prepare for that. Oh, how do you do that? Well, You plan a mind virus. For example, a Mayan virus. I like it. Yeah, Perry Mason type shit. Yeah, like what he did like if the money's missing and if I said to you, is there any reason somebody would have told me that they saw you near that cashbox about the time it went missing Tom Tom Tom? Okay. Now people talk at a hundred twenty-five words a minute. They think at twelve to fourteen hundred words a minute now if it takes you five five seconds to tell me no, You took the money because if you weren't nervous right now cause you if you didn't take it, you know, you didn't take it. You don't need to run scenarios through your head to think who could have seen me where I've been I'm all right. I didn't see anybody. Nobody could have seen me what did it but if you didn't do it, it doesn't take you one millisecond to say absolutely not. Have you ever been wrong before we see someone on television to go. I think that guy's guilty and they're innocent or vice versa. Oh sure because if you really want to know for sure if somebody is guilty or innocent you need to invest a lot of time you need to get a baseline of what they normally look like talk like feel like and then banned in knowing that Baseline. You didn't need to compare how they're behaving on TV. So just walking by the screen and seeing it. You might see things that would ordinarily be lie behaviors that could just be part of their personality. So if you're going to really make a judgment, you got to put a lot of time in and figure it out and what you should do before you decide you're going to be a human lie detector is do your homework and you have to try to figure it out objectively before you figure it out. Behaviorally. I mean you all have to do your investigation find out if somebody took the money and you know find out where they were in, you know, look for fingerprints and do this and do that. I mean you ought to really objectively figure it out before you rely on these things. And so unless you get a Baseline and get one-on-one with them and spend a lot of time then you can't be you can't be really certain that you know, whether they're telling the truth or whether or not it's it would be fun if it was that easy. And that some people are pretty obvious. Yeah, I heard a cop once say that when people are guilty. They tend to plead and cry and then when they're not guilty they tend to get angry when they're accused people that are wrongly accused are generally I right from the beginning till the end. I mean every case is different, but if you're wrongly accused that person is going to be pissed off from the minute you accuse them till the end because like I'm their self-righteous like I didn't do this and you're saying I did screw you. Yeah, and they don't take a step back and when you you see people they do these convincing statements and they're pleading for you to believe them. And then anytime somebody says now, in all honesty Usually the next thing out of their mouth is a lie, like, you know, Joe honestly as opposed to everything else. You've been telling me right? Why are we we bracketing this one out. He's all right, or if they invoke the deity. Oh, I swear my good God. Yeah God as my witness. Mmm. And you know, I don't know whether I have not done what I said you need to do with Jesse Smollett, but I do know when he went to the set at Fox he said You all know me. I swear to God I didn't do this and there were like three or four of those kind of statements in like two or three sentences there. Well, my favorite ones is on stage called himself the gay Tupac that's enough for me. That's a little narcissistic. It's a strange thing though. Like there was another one today a guy lit his house on fire and think in Chicago and said he's a gay fella said was a hate crime and they caught him. So a lot of that going on, you know, a lot of fake crime, very strange the then sometimes people accuse people or something and someone will say, why would why would someone make something I why would someone turn themselves into a victim what there's a lot of clout and being a victim especially today. There's a lot of you get a lot of attention a lot of love. I think there's a lot of false accusations and false. There's is a lot of real ones, but man when the false ones come but you just does a giant disservice to everybody. 
========,9,title.
Well, there's a fair amount of research is to why people? Do these hoaxes and particularly hate crime hoaxes and one of the primary motivation, of course, it's sympathy and attention and all that but one of the interesting reasons that I've read in the research is that they really feel like it's emblematic of how the system treats them. Overall. This is just a dramatic example of it only if they feel like I'm treated this way anyhow, so they're just I'm discriminated against I suffered by us. I'm put down this is just a focused example of that. So I'm really not lying. I'm just role-playing how I'm over all treated. Oh wow. So they justified in their mind if they're just going to bring all this treatment into one example to bring it into focus. And so while it's a phony deal it really is truthful representation of what their life is really like they In that way. Oh, how weird yeah. That's yeah, that's deep psychological shit out there. Yeah, that's that's stretching. That's a weird one. We like what you write it out like that. Put it in your mind that way. Yeah. Wow, it's just strange too because it gives people this this it's just this giant public show to watch now, you know, and I hate that feeling what a talented young man. I mean is he he's I've the times that I've seen I don't watch that show a lot but the times I've seen him on their singing and assuming it is his voice and he singing hmm extremely talented young man. I find a lot of talented people are fucking crazy. Well, you know, somebody said that somebody said that the really talented singers and actors were the weird kids from high school that were in drama and all that. I don't have yeah for sure. Yeah very slow. Was a crazy obviously not all deceptive. But you know, some of the most brilliant actors are just completely out of their mind and that's one of the reasons why they're so good at acting is because they can look my friend what my friend Wayne Federman had a bit they did about it on stage and he's like guess what it's not fucking normal to be able to just cry. Yeah, because you could just cry and pretend something's wrong and cries. I that's crazy. These are crazy people. Yeah, and and and you really can't go to a certain place if you don't have a little of that in you. Yeah. My dad used to always say when he's working with patients who would say something about that old boy. I can't stand about me because he say you can't see it in them. If you don't have a little of it in you. Yeah, there's some truth in all there's a hundred percent truth in that that is the thing that Rising the craziest about weak people. I'm so terrified of seeing weakness and and just just just just being pathetic. I'm so terrified of seeing that in myself. I see. Other people it's just it smells I smelled like a drug-sniffing dog like oh, there it is. Yeah, you smell desperation. Yes, we what makes you do this. 
========,9,title.
Why are you doing a podcast? I have always been a blabbermouth. I can never shut the fuck up. I love talk and and I've always been fascinated by human beings and their lives and just talking to people and finding out like the guy before was this guy. Yo on Grillo who's a Narcotics journalist. He's a narco journalists in Mexico. I mean I couldn't wait to talk to that guy. Oh, yeah that me. Just what a life. He's been living in Mexico for 18 years is from England. I might still alive. So that's that's something right there. Yeah, and he you know, he's telling me about friends that have been killed and you know, he's been in some sticky situations a few times and you know, I'm just fascinated by Pit by people and what they like to do, you know, I'm fascinated by athletes. I'm fascinated by physicists. I was just always been very Over curious and I've always recognize that everyone thinks about things differently in that. I could take a little bit of something from everybody whether it's from a book or from have a conversation with someone I can gain a little bit of a little bit of experience a little bit of knowledge little bit of insight. Yeah, you're naturally very curious. Because I listened to you interviews and you're naturally very curious. You don't struggle for the next question because you really want to know something that makes it much easier does very lucky that I found this. Yes, very just stumbled into doing this kind of Shannon wasn't this way in the beginning in the beginning was just horse shitting with friends and it's slowly but surely as the pot the podcast became popular. I was like, I wonder if that guy would talk to me and then I would get people on and then it became more of these long form interesting conversations. Yeah. Yeah it if you're curious about human functioning at all human nature at all. There's an endless menu of things you can talk about I don't care who it is. You could you could pull somebody out of a car on the street. Yeah, and if you're curious you can talk to him because everybody has a different take in life. Everybody has a different walk. Yeah, absolutely and what you're talking about you're interviewing all these athletes, you know, I think people tend to write off athletic Pursuits as being entirely physical and there. On I mean, I think this is an easy way for people to look at it that don't engage or that never really thought about playing anything at a very high level that it requires some intense thinking it might not require mathematics or a large vocabulary but understanding what's required understanding when and how to execute understanding how to keep your shit together Under Pressure. Those are all intensely intellectual aspects of any really high-end athletic Pursuit and there's a different breed of cat that wants the ball with the buzzer. Yes, there's and that's not just a Showboat. There's a different breed of cat that wants that ball at that point. Yeah, and it's not always who you think but that takes a special kind of person that wants that pressure. Yeah, that knows they can handle it better than anybody else. Yeah, you know and it's a lot of times it's people that are entirely confident that they've done the work, you know, there's a haunting That happens with athletes where you're not sure if you did enough and in Fighters, it's a very dangerous inclination because it leads you to over train and you have to be very careful about that because with a fighter you only can learn so much during your training camp like say once you get into training camp, you got 8 weeks depending on who you are some guys like to do a little longer, but the average is maybe eight twelve weeks is a Long Camp. You already have to know how to fight by time you get to Camp. So what you're really doing is just kind of working on specific movements where you're dealing with one kind of fighter and then getting your body in shape getting your body condition to getting your mind ready preparing everything cutting your body weight down getting so you can weigh in and have a good amount of just did you gotta have enough Vitality can't train yourself. So this is complicated dance that goes on and that haunting thing of did I do enough can cause fighters to screw them. Was over by overtraining. Yeah, so you have to have enough confidence to know that you've done enough as well as enough. You have to know you've done enough but no you haven't done too much.
========,9,title.
This is really strange dance, you know and this this this weekend is a giant UFC big UFC to Big title fights between for the very best fighters in the world. And I mean that is one of the most interesting aspects of the fight game to me is one watching these guys stare each other down at the weigh-in where they get a look at each other and they know 24 hours from now, they're going to war and just see like, is there a just a smell of Doubt? Is there anything is there anything in there? You know and just knowing that this is probably one of the most difficult things in all of Athletics and that these guys are going to there they're going to ply their trade and one of the most complicated things. It's a battle of physical mental of of mindset. Will of conditioning and discipline and then it's also there's a lot of random shit that happens. Do you think if I can change at a weigh-in when people are looking at each other? Yeah, you think it yeah, it can change it can shift right then. It can't change Forever by like you could look at Jon Jones sideways upside down you could stick your dick in ink enough effect shit. There's some guys that are just locked down and bulletproof. Jon Jones bulletproof. There's certain guys that is just bulletproof. They just look at you and like they know what to do. The reason why he's undefeated, you know, he's just he knows how to do it. But then there's other guys that like that maybe like fucking maybe it's 80/20 maybe and then the the staredown you look at the guy and you look at him like God damn it. I'm fighting yoel Romero how the fuck did this happen? And then you see him drop down to 75 maybe seventy three percent confidence 72 70 shit. They look at his traps. He's got a neck that starts the top of his head, you know like off. Fuck, you know, there's certain guys. They're just they're intimidating at Wayans to yeah. Yeah, it can change a little bit but not for everybody. There's certain guys that just it doesn't matter. You can't get in there. There's certain Champions like real champions. Like Mighty Mouse Johnson is a bunch of guys like that. They're just Champions. You look at him. It doesn't matter. They're what they've done what they're doing. They've done the work to the best in the business. Like you can mean mug them and get aggressive. They might smile at you then like this is cute. Try to make me nervous hilarious. See you tomorrow. Yeah. So is that because they know who they are and it doesn't matter who this is. Or is it that they just don't they don't believe in this guy. It's they know who they are. I think and they have reached a level of confidence when you get to a certain level of success. Like you know, Jon Jones has one loss in his record. It's by disqualification to fight that he was destroying the guy and he was hitting the guy with it's a really dumb rule. But when you throw elbows, you're not allowed to throw a 12 to 6 elbow meaning coming straight down. The only reason that exists is because when mixed martial arts is first being was first being sanctioned by athletic commissions, the the people that were in the athletic commission had some nervous fears of they had seen like those late-night TV shows were karate guys are breaking bricks with their elbow driving straight down. They thought they could kill somebody if they did that. So let's not have will eliminate that strike. It's a dumb move and Jon Jones hit this guy with a couple 12 to 6 elbows and he was disqualified in a fight. He was just just destroying the guy so for a guy like that who This staggering resume of achievement is widely considered to be the greatest light heavyweight champion of all time. If not, he's definitely in the running of the greatest fighter ever of all time for a guy like that. He's not he's he's confident to the point of you know, he's he's he's not trying to just beat this guy. Although he's going to beat this guy. He's trying to go down in history as one of the greatest of all time or the greatest of all time. So for a guy like that, it doesn't matter what you do where he's at. He's a Michael Jordan type character, you know, there's a few of those guys out there this these LeBron James is these Larry Bird's there exists in all sports. They have this mindset a champion mindset. Does he find angry or does he fight business like business like he's very businesslike. Yeah, he's very businesslike. He just knows what he's doing the best guys fight business like this. Some guys have fight with emotion and they're still really good but like fade or emelianenko's is famous Russian guy, he would he would have a look on his face like he was cashing a check and he's smashing a guy's eye orbit in he was just you know, he was the highest level of that like that robotic businesslike approach to fighting and then after he knocked unconscious he helped me get back up. Yeah. It was over once. He shut it off. It was over there was no no sign of he thought emotions were weak like showing emotions in a fight showing anger all that was weak. Yeah. I think there's a huge psychological component to I mean, I agree completely giant gigantic. I think if you think if you go in with doubt man, I think that's terrible terrible. I think if you just now you're fighting yourself and them to remember the Mike Tyson fights when he was in his prime. Oh, yeah. Remember to look in those guys face. Oh, yeah, they're staring across the ring and I'm like, oh Jesus. What did I sign up for? Yeah, there's like this is the I don't know what the money was here, but it wasn't worth it. This seemed like a good idea at the time was how is life changing life defining moment. When you when you were staring across the ring at Iron Mike and it was like 1989. It was a top of the world. Yeah, and and he and you knew he's going to come over there and it's you like you've never been here before. Yeah guns blazing Yeah, Eddie did yeah and he did. Yeah. Meanwhile, you meet him now. He's like the nicest guy on the planet Earth. Yeah couldn't be a sweeter guy. Yeah, I talked to me today.He's got a daughter that's apparently a pretty good tennis player, really and he's really behind her now and focused on that that was him back then because when he came out of jail, he's fighting Peter McNeeley. 
========,9,title.
Just letting them know it's common baby carrot Fight Man till he was never he was never as formidable after jail as he was before he went in. Yeah. No. Well, there's a ton of factors. His training was never the same. You know, he didn't he lost that connection with custom model, you know had custom motto was training them when he was at his very best and then Kevin Rooney who worked with custom model and Mike trained him after that and then they eventually parted ways and that was before the Buster Douglas fight. Remember he had guys in his Corner didn't even have an ends. Well, I mean his leg was swelling up and they didn't have ice to put on it. Yeah. Yeah, there was a lot of factors but also, you know when I talked to Mike on the podcast one of the things was and this was just himSort of coming with to grips with the fact that he never really had a childhood. His childhood was the from the time I was 12 years old custom model took him in was hypnotizing him and teaching him how to fight teach amount of fighting in hypnotizing him to be a machine his going in, you know, he was literally saying to him you don't exist the task exist the job at hand exists and you're going to go out there and you're going to get the job done and he was telling this to a 13 year old that never experienced love. He just was abandoned and homeless and and this is the only way he ever got any sort of positive reinforcement in his life is by destroying people. Yeah.And that's sad but you know now he seems to really be connected to his daughter. I mean you see a you see and hear a softness in his voice. He really is connected. Yeah, he learned no, I mean it's easy to try to look at someone like who they were, you know, 20 years ago. It's easy to do that. It's easy to just oh, he's that guy but people evolve and they grow and he's a great example of that. He's a very different person. He doesn't even work out because he's worried about his ego. Like he doesn't hit the bag or do anything like that. It's occasionally get on the treadmill workout a little bit on a treadmill just get a little exercise in but he's worried about feeding his ego was worried about like looking at himself in the mirror and bring that old monster back again. Really? Yeah. That's what he said, huh? Yeah. I think you'd be afraid of not being able to get back to the level. He was I think he's afraid of that. I don't think he wants to be that guy. Yeah. He says he doesn't like that guy, but which is crazy because that guy isWho made him rich and famous and everybody loves him because he was that guy but who he is now is a completely different person just a sweetheart a real sweetheart. Yeah, he seems like it. I mean you'd never think to talk to him. If you didn't know his history you'd never guess. That was that guy. Yeah. Now you never would yeah, I think the psychological aspect of fighting is one of the more intriguing parts of it to me and you know for me it's like probably one of the reasons why I got interested in psyche in the first place and the way people think about things and weakness like real weakness is weakness weakness in get exposed in a variety of different ways, but in competitions when you really see it, yeah.

I'm one of the I have this Theory and we see it in sports and I saw it when I talked to him and he's been a friend of mine for a long time andI was talking to him about his psychology as he goes into a football game and he says he plays a movie in his mind of the entire game before he plays it because you know the football game you're going to have 11 or 12 possessions during the game and you just threw out the football game you can get that ball 11 or 12 times and he would say and I'm going to carry that ball three or four times per possession and he knows which plays he's going to run he would run them through his head. He would see it. He would know who was going to be there to tackle him. He would see, you know, he'd run everything through his head and he's one of those guys that wants the ball when the clocks running and yeah, but I have this theory that situations do not make Heroes situations expose Heroes and I saw that in Katrina the hurricane that so devastated that that one neighborhood. What Ward was it? Is it the ninth ward? I forget which Ward it was that gotSo wiped out. When Katrina hit New Orleans and there was a guy down there that had been really quiet. Nobody has ever heard anything out of him. He was an older guy lived in a house stayed to himself and that night when the water was at rooftop level. I mean he swam rooftop to Rooftop and save six seven eight people got him out of there and he didn't make it out, but he got seven or eight people out of there and you go back and you check his history and he was a military hero. He just sat quietly in his home. And when the situation came about it revealed who he was and I think that's what happens. I think if you've got a hero they just sit there sit there sit there until a situation reveals who they are. I don't think it makes him a hero. I think it reveals that their Heroes and I think that's what happens to people they They are who they are until they get in in the opportunity to comes along and they're going to show you who that is. They may show you their a coward or they may show you that they've got the focus to hang or they may show you that there are hero but life circumstances are going to come along and you're going to show you who somebody is. Yeah, I completely agree and I think what's also interesting is when someone does get revealed to be a coward they can become a hero. It's very hard. It's very hard to get past the the memory of you being a coward. Well, I'll tell you why I think that's true. If you want to know please I mean maybe you know, I'm going away with it going off on a tangent. Come on now. I think I think we learn about ourselves and you know, everybody talks about self-esteem and self-worth but nobody ever talks about what it really is or how we get it and I think I think about it in terms of self attribution because you know how you form opinions of other people like if you look at this guy and you maybe you work with this guy and so you watch him across a couple of years and maybe this guy shows up to work every day and he's there 15 minutes early and he unlocks the place gets everything ready put the coffee on has his desk ready. He's all buttoned up and man when the bell rings. He's ready to go and you just learned that this guy's buttoned up ready to go Dependable never misses. He's always there. So you attribute. Traits and characteristics to him based on your observations of him and your experience of him based on that you assign certain traits and characteristics to him but I say that's exactly the same way. We form our own self-image and our own level of self-worth we watch ourselves go through life and we watch how we handle certain circumstances and situations and that's why I say overindulgence is one of the most Insidious forms of child abuse known to Parenting. It's not the worst. It's just Insidious because if you overindulge your children and do everything for them, you never let them observe themselves Master their environment. You never let them step back and say wow, I did that I built this I overcame that I handled this I did that and so we that's the same way. We make our own self-image. Jin level of self-worth we watch ourselves overcome the third grade we watch ourselves stand up to a bully we watch ourselves handle a test with a information that intimidated us or we watch ourselves make it onto the little league baseball team and actually get a hit when we needed to or we watch ourselves get onto the debate team and actually argue something successfully whether it's academic or athletic or musical we watch ourselves do it. And so we go back and say hey I did that I attribute to myself the ability I can hang I can do this. I can rise to the occasion or we watch ourselves fold like a pup tent in a windstorm and say yeah, I can't hang I don't have it and we make those attributions to ourselves. And so we shrink from The Challenge for the rest of our lives until like you said, it's hard to overcome that and something pushes you Up until you finally observe yourself overcome something and I think that's how we form our level of self-esteem and our identity about who we are and I don't think most people think about that going to look back and say okay. How did I how did I get to be Joe Rogan as I sit in that chair you have a self-image you have a level of confidence and ego strength a level of self worth that's attributable to things you've watched yourself do or not do achieve not achieve overcome or whatever throughout your life. And and I think to know yourself you have to know what those things are. I think you're a hundred percent. Right and I think for children participating in things that are going to test you so critical giving them this opportunity to realize that the the there's a line between success and failure and that you could push through that line. You could you could become successful at something and watching kids at this. I think sports are so important for children. I think that's one of the more Insidious things about having these participation trophies for kids where that nobody wins the game. Yeah, everybody plays but nobody wins. We don't keep score. Why the fuck are you playing? Yeah, I mean that just goes down as an environmental non-event. Yeah. I mean that that contributes nothing to your definition is just something to do. It's also psychologically it's coddling. It's very it's very damaging for your potential education that you would get from that situation the bad feeling that you get when someone scores on you is motivation for you to be better at defense. Yeah, you know, I think we cheat kids when we do that and of course, it's got to play everybody. I can I get that not everybody is meant to be an athlete so, okay. Look go do something else. Yeah be good at what you're good at and if you really want to do it. Well, you've got a long road. It's a greased. He'll start Yeah, it's everything's not for everybody. So find what you're good at and watch yourself achieve in that lane. You know, that's like I can't I can't carry a tune in a bucket. I can't I can't even I can play no instrument. I can't sing I can play a radio of it's got a big on off knob that's it. And so I don't try I mean that's I'm just not good at that. So I go into lanes and I can do stuff and observe myself in that but I think you cheat kids. If you don't let them observe themselves faced adversity and overcome it absolutely and it's also an interesting lesson to learn that life isn't fair. I mean if you're a kid and you're playing basketball with a fifteen-year-old LeBron James and you're my height you go, huh? Yeah. Yeah. This ain't gonna work out at all. Yeah, you look at a towel boy here. This is not fucking happening. Yeah, and you have to be able to understand that and appreciate that and then Firstly if you're very physically frail, you know, maybe wrestling's not for you either. You know, maybe maybe you need to do something about your body before you engage in any sort of a combat sport, you know, they did an experiment back in like it was the 60s. They did something called teaching machines. 
========,9,title.
Have you ever seen that? No, it was a short period of time but they took students in the class where they put the steps of learning the information. So close together that there was never a failure experience. It would say like the War of 1812 happened in 1812. Then the next thing would say the War of 1812 happened in blank you feeling 1812. I mean come on potted plant could get that so they put it together and you they would teach the information and they would teach it to criteria where you mastered the information. You've had it a hundred percent and they said wow, this is great. Everybody learned it. So everybody made a hundred everybody got the information. They truly did learn it. There's no question about it. They learned the information and so they did great then they took him out of that program and put them back in the regular classroom. And the first time they came to questions, they didn't know the answer to the first time. They didn't get a hundred. They came apart like a cheap suit. They Panic they didn't know how to handle adversity. They didn't know how to handle it when they didn't have the right answers. They didn't learn how to not be perfect. And so they scrapped the whole program because he said you can't do this because that's not the way life is right. And if I mean, it's you're not teaching them how the real world works you might as well teach them to go on read and stop on green and then give them the keys and put them out in life because that's not the way it works. And those kids were absolutely screwed up when they got into a truly competitive environment. You can't be success only. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. It's not healthy. It's not good for you. You don't learn from it. I mean the whole idea about school is you're supposed to be setting kids up for the future. He supposed to be teaching them not just information. Nation but teaching them how to learn and how to improve that worries me. But you know, I read that story not long ago when you students. I think it was at UCLA in law school. Complained and got a professor either disciplined or fired because he required them to take a counter argument over something controversial like Ferguson. He said I want you to you know, I know you that you're all on this point of view now. I want you to prepare an argument for the other side. Mmm, and they all said, oh that's that's upsetting to us. We just which can't do it and they went to the administration and complained. Wow, that's crazy because you may have to as a lawyer you may have to represent someone who's done something you don't agree with if that's what you want to do for a living right? Are you kidding me? They were like needed therapy. Mike what the hell has happened here. Oh my God, that's so crazy. Yeah, that's not that's crazy. You know, yeah. Well, there's a there's a movement going on in this country right now the social justice movement and it leans in that direction that people don't want to look at things for how they are. They want to look at things for how they want them to be. Yeah that just I just don't understand you cannot Legislate that everything is going to be equal for everybody because everybody's not equal. I'm sorry. They're not equal. They may be equal in terms of their value as a human being. Yes, but they're not equal in math skills. They're not equal in how fast they run. They're not equal in creativity. They're not equal. Everybody has their own value, but that doesn't mean they're marketable skills in an open Society in an open market are going to be the same now. It's ridiculous. I used to have I had a joke on the one of my special. So two specials ago about there was a story about a woman who is guarding the White House. She was the Lone guard at one of the doors of the White House and some crazy man broke in and knocked her to the ground and just ran through the White House and he was running around inside the White House for like three minutes before they finally some off-duty secret service agent tackled. This guy. I saw like what the fuck is going on these guys run through the White House tackle this guy. And the joke was that people think that a woman can do everything a man can do I go when we could do everything a man could do is that true and some woman he was in the crowd of the comic stores like yes, I go. Well, that doesn't make any fucking sense. Here's why it doesn't make any sense because a man can't do everything a man can do I go look I've met Shaquille O'Neal and his dick is where my face is and if the White House is experiencing a shack attack. I'm the wrong person save the world because he's gonna run right over me I go but if my wife and kid were guarding the White House. Guess what I'm getting in. Yeah. Okay. I love my family. But if it's between me and get like there's no way they're gonna be able to stop me. I love them to death, but I'm a man and they're women and if there's a woman guarding the White House, I don't care who she is. I'll fuck her up. It's not going to happen. This is crazy. But this someone had this idea that they would put a woman in charge. Charge of a very physical job. You should have a giant man with a violent temper and he should be armed. Okay, because this is the guy that's keeping bad people from the fucking president. Yeah. I just I don't I don't understand. It just seems like you got to find your own lane. I mean, yeah, you don't want to put me in the NBA. Well, yeah physical things in particular when then and then there's also mental things. Look I suck at math. Okay, if everyone has a chance to work at CERN, right? Everyone has a chance to work at the Large Hadron Collider including people that have no idea about physics. We're going to a real time making these equations work. Yeah. That's what I mean about finding your own lane. Yeah Q I can add two and two and get five every time I'm just not good at math, but I'm good with words. I can talk I can read fast. I can comprehend well, but I am not good with math. So I got myself into a lane where I talk for a living. I read I talk I it's qualitative. Quantitative I can accept that I'm not suited for that. I mean that I don't feel bad about myself because of that once you do something and you're good at it. You can accept not being good at other things. It's much easier. If you find a thing that you're good at whether it's gymnastics or singing or painting whatever the fuck it is. If you could find a thing that you're good at it'll make you it'll give you a feeling of self-worth and you won't need to be good at everything. Yeah, you can accept and you can enjoy other people being good at things as well. Yeah, you know I said earlier my dad was an alcoholic and I would compare myself to that kid across because I had a damaged personal truth, but I found a currency because at that time in my life, I was a pretty decent athlete for this small school. I was going to so that was my currency. Yeah. So now it didn't matter what was happening at home because I got Strokes for being able to jump high and run fast. It's cool so that became my currency. So now when I compared myself Him. Okay, maybe my home life wasn't as good as his but I could run faster and jump higher so that became my currency. So now I okay that level the playing field for me. Yeah, and you all would like you said find what you're good at at a given time and do what you're good at. Yeah, find something you love find something you're passionate about and that you could also excel at and if you can work it out where it's your vocation and your avocation you love doing it and you get paid for it then you're just double blast. Yeah, you got it, right because you enjoy doing this and it works out and that's good. Yeah, you catch lucky breaks. Yeah if you admit that but that's boy. That's lucky. Yeah it is and if I just think if you're in your life, and there's you don't have something that you're passionate about I mean and I don't mean that in a cliche Quay if there's not something where you wake up every day, and there's nothing in your life that you're excited to do. Man, you need to go back to the drawing board because if all you're doing is just grinding it out you get up every day. Go to a job. You don't like do tasks. You don't care to do and come home to a home. You don't want to come home to and wait to get them do it again the next day. You're burning daylight. What the hell is existence? Is that yeah. I just I don't I don't understand that that find something. I don't care if it's gardening or music or art or Athletics or something find something you're excited to do. Yeah expose yourself to different things with that very purpose of finding something that you love doing something out there. Yeah. There's something out there. I guarantee you something. Yeah. There's something healthy. It's not illegal. It's not going to be high risk. There's something you can do. That's not going to kill you or put you in jail at you can be excited about. Yeah, and I think it's one of the most Portent things to do when you're a parent is to try to expose your kid to as many different things as possible to find those things for them. Yeah, and I got two boys, you know, and you know, one of them really well and I did that growing up because my dad never took me hunting a single day in his life. He never took me fishing a single day in his life. He never took me camping a single day in his life. You never took me to the lake. You never took me skiing boating anything. So Irish. I took them to all of those things. I didn't know I had no clue what I was doing, but I took him turkey hunting duck hunting deer hunting. She's skiing snow skiing camping. I did it all and to see what they like let them pick. Yeah and boy when you don't know what you're doing. As a dad, that's a bitch. Yeah. Let me just little things like you you go camping and you don't realize that sitting your 10 up on the side of a hill. Even if it's like 8 or 10 degrees is a bad idea. Yes, sleep you got to get on flat ground. I mean look flat to me, but can I try not to roll down a downhill? It didn't look like it was on a slant but it was but you figure these things out as you go along but I was glad I gave him those experiences so they could choose and they did and they landed some of it they like some of it they didn't well, I don't know both you kids but I love Jay. Yeah. Yeah, Jay loves you. He really enjoys spending time with you guys and traveling with you guys. And yeah, we've had a bunch of great trips. Yeah. He's an awesome guy really is so much fun. Yeah, he knows how to have a good time. And he says the same thing about you. He's you know, how to have a good time. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen, man tell people how to get ahold of your podcast working the It well, it's fill in the blanks. And that's Phi l in the blanks. And yeah, I guess you get it everywhere podcaster. Gotten right? Yep iTunes All That Jazz iTunes Apple Stitcher all the different places. There. It is right there. Look at you you handsome bastard. Yeah. Look at that. I mean, how about that? Nice? How do you clean up? Pretty good though? See the good thing about being bald is you look the same all the time. Yes, that's true. And you save money on shampoo. You shave money on shampoo, and I've been bald since I was like 12 so really my hair fell out really early. Wow. I'm never playing college football at take my helmet off and look like I had an animal in there. What the hell is going on my teammates to say what the hell is in your helmet? It's my hair. Shut up. I don't know why but it just fell out. I guess it got knocked out. Well the mustache works too. Yeah. Well some like I can't rock a mustache. I'd look a little creepy with one. Yeah. Well I try to keep it. Don't look like total porn stuff though. How do you do that? You gotta embrace your weaknesses. Yeah. I mean, I remember when I wrote my first book on Oprah. She said you'll feel you won't have any trouble finding this got his big old ball head right there on the front of it. So I figure you know, he'll make it a trademark right for went hard on you. Yeah. She doesn't beginning I got no complaints. Yeah. Oh I hear you. She treated me pretty right. Yeah, it worked out great. Hey, thanks for having me on my pleasure. You got to come to mine. Absolutely. Alright. Alright. Thanks, man. Dr. Phil ladies and gentlemen.
