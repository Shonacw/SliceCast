I can keep it in check for 3 to I would like first of all Steve. Thank you very much for doing this. I really appreciate it. Been a big fan of your work for a long time and you bring up some really fascinating subjects and we were talking right before the podcast about social media and how weird it is that you got lumped in with the alt right for a comment saying something along the lines of that you find. What was the exact quote something on the highly intelligent people seem to which not saying they're good people equate them with a skinheads in the neo-nazis carrying the tiki torches and I hope you know, I I know some of them some of them are former students and some of them are highly intelligent and highly red. So but that's not what people often think of when I think of the alt right now, People in check there's some people universities to stay under cover and I would have made some remarks on how to starve that movement. I had to feed it. But so many people jumped on it as if you were endorsing the alt-right is an exact quote you were just so basically saying something along the lines of is it a lot of intelligent people that are involved in this the various taboos in mainstream intellectual culture because of political correctness, but we all try to discover them. They feel tremendous Manpower like we are now privy to the truth that the establishment can't handle you can't handle the truth and since it was never discussed in the open. There are no counter-arguments to some of the most toxic interpretation. And so the alt-right can run with the never never having been in a forum where these things are debated and criticized put into context they take like one fact and then they draw the most extreme conclusions if these Debated in the first place. Then you realize that those conclusions are not warranted experiment example is there are average differences between men and women and a lot of psychological traits if that's that's often quite Taboo in intellectual circles for I think Bazaar reasons to get people to think that somehow women's rights depend on men and women being indistinguishable bad equation in the first place. But as soon as you come across the fact that men and women on average across the fact that a lot of these traits that whatever trait you name that men on average are better at than women or vice versa. There are a lot of women who are better than a lot of men or vice versa. So you can't really judge an individual from the average of their therapists are sex. Also, even though there are some traits We're Men scorable better than women are some traits were wouldn't score blue better than that and that that's the complete picture but the thing is If the entire subject is out of bounds, you never get to present the complete picture and some people run away with all men and women are totally different. What what are your thoughts on how the subject got out of bounds? Cuz it's it's very confusing to meet a certain subjects. Like the differences between genders are so taboo when they seem so obvious and you just could go to the mall and just look at the way the men dress in the women dress. You wore the same obvious distinctions here fast. If they fit men were intellectual in women, we're not in women were governed by their emotions and there we thought too much it would take blood away from their ovaries and that woman they wouldn't be fertile. And then maybe I'll miserable crazy stuff and as a reaction to that in the 70s when the second wave of feminism became prominent cut it became almost an article of faith that there were no differences between men and I am so if you say that their differences between men and women, you're sending women back today to the kitchen of the nursery because fairness is not the same as sameness obviously women should have equal rights to men whether or not they're caught that exact copies of Mentor have distinctive profile as men have a distinct profile. So I think it's just a mistake to to conflate the issue of women's rights with men and women being identical, but that's the way it kind of shook out and it became kind of an article of faith in in a lot of pain in some salmon and some kind of left liberal circles that many women have to be identical and they aren't that means you're a traitor you've to to women's equality important mean fair being tired of each other and but being fair is also recognizing differences. That's right and not assuming that any differences of deficiency. Differences between men and women Middleton come out looking so good. When we were looking at the reaction to this though. It was strange to me was how many people seemed like, they wanted to jump on board and criticize you and I think a lot of it is almost like to take away some of the potential criticism of themselves. Like it's instant claiming of the moral High Ground virtue signaling and it's just very disappointed when you see this from intellectuals and college professors and it's should know better not get in too much trouble from from my peers and hung up professors grad students and someone there a couple of trolls who who who ran with it, but by and large the mainstream reaction was as long as a sign of a Senior Transport at the social media is making a stupid. Indication of how these mobs outrage can corrupt any kind of intelligent discourse discussions does discussions that involve Nuance like complicated issues that are the complex State. They require a long-distance sort of description of the issue and a very complex sort of take on these various differences between men and women and the alt right and the left and political discussions me. These aren't something that you can smash into a very short sound bite and completely cover your take on things all the more reason that they shouldn't be taboo because he I can't discuss them. Then the only interpretation you can have as a simplistic one. If you could bring about it be open and you can start to have that discussion. Yeah. I'm hoping that this is turning around. I'm hoping that what's happened is the outrage culture. The outrage culture has become almost a parody of itself has gotten so ridiculous that people will sort of shy away from outrage seemingly, like the same reason why people are terrified of talking about the differences between men and women is cuz they don't want to be grouped into the people that literally legitimately rather were sexist. Yeah, and the the meaning of the 19 hundreds and they Hundreds of these people that did have these terrible idea. So now we're trying to go so far away from that we become a little bit ridiculous and I'm hoping things until I'm hoping it's a swing and they'll just kind of bounced back towards the middle.

Yeah. Yeah, I decided there's there's some hope that that just with any medium is new MLB these excesses and it takes a while for the system to kind of re re equilibrate have an immune response that that dance down the worst of it in a long time and in the in the 80s when it was mainly academics and computer scientists, who is before the the World Wide Web was all text and this is concept of flinging an award given us a joke award called at the Flaming asshole Awards Cal really Brandy the app to the the the worst insult her in these intellectual discussion. GTA V trophy wasn't supposed to be that his bestest cork or STI verb to Flame Ramadan in the discussion groups. It was well, let's not turn this into a flame Lauren Drive-Ins and when people realize that this was a thing, then they could push back against it and let's hope that that happens with his social media again. Yeah, I hope so. It was a sport in like the late 90s early 2000 to is essential to like an online support like someone would say something about you and you don't cry and how do I practice and it was it was more fun than anything and I felt like there was very few people relatively speaking involved in discussion groups back. Then in terms of like the mass amount of people are on social media now everyone is in some form of Sodor. Abhorrent some form of social media. Now, where is the number of people that were on message boards was so small and so smell that's right here in your African American snapping their when people realize it's is a sport than you know and gets hurt. It's just like, you know, what really gets attacked people's reputations that then you got a problem.

We have a thing in comedy called roast battle that hosting another and roast battle is this this great show that they do at The Comedy Store every Tuesday where comedians will prepare insults against each other, right? But my friend Brian Moses who hosts it at the end of everything. They always hug it out like this. It's always like know that this is a joke writing exercise and a fun joke writing show and no one really, you know, they would means any of this and I really mean is that at the end just a hug Just add me just like I like it like a professional boxing a route with fighting. Sometimes people can misunderstand that there's that famous, press roast where Obama had some fun at the expense of Donald Trump when he was a still to start a reality show and you could see famous sladek the camera zoomed in on Trump and he was not amused at no expense in there is a theory that one of the reasons that he plotted his presidential run was tipped was to get revenge. Well, that's what Obama said during that roast. And here's one of the things that I am that you'll never be president of the United States and Italy not crazy and she could have turned out very well. Apparently. He had been thinking about being president for a long long time, but that might might have been the straw that broke the camel's back Barack what you've done. When you see social media today, like as a psychologist and you see this thing that people do when they can behave anonymously in the absence of social cues not in front of each other. Not not seeing that how the cruel things hurt each other. How does that make you a good deed? You think that this is just an unnatural way of communicating face-to-face contact and the big discoveries of Psychology from over the last couple decades. Is that where moral animals to the extent that we have reputations going back to Richard Dawkins famous book The Selfish Gene what he posed the question how could niceness and generosity and cooperation evolved given that in darwinian competition you'd expect they're the most aggressive the most selfish to Promenade and is an answer to that question and Dawkins worked it out. 1976 based on book about a biologist which is it if there is reciprocity. That is if I remember the nice things that you did to me and I feel compelled to pay them and conversely if you do something that harms me and I threatened revenge and people can kind of settle into cooperation because we really are better off if we extend favors to each other that do a lot of good to the other in response to a fairly minor inconvenience to the South. If everyone does that everyone's better off and that's only stable though. If everyone has a memory for what everyone else did therefore in that sets up a pressure to cultivate your reputation as someone who will is trustworthy and will reciprocate but without the reputation about the memory of who did what and how generous and trustworthy. Somewhat is the whole thing can unravel when you get back to it what people think Is darwinian competition mainly of nature red in tooth and Claw. It's a bloody battle. It's a reputation is really it's not just a matter of kind of eagle or burnishing your credentials. That's really what makes all cooperation niceness kindness possible. And so when you have an arena in which the you first saw you don't have face-to-face contact, so you don't have the kind of evolved responses that we have two two getting along. I mainly it's a big deal to insult someone to their there. They're facing people do what you got to do is take that away and it's just typing a bunch of characters of keyboard and especially if the person doing the typing as a as a handle that is to Anonymous and that kind of eliminate some of the constraints on Civility and generosity and been maintaining a reputation as a credible cooperator.

I also feel that there's there's a selfishness and being nice and being generous. Cuz I like the way I described I think it feels good. Yeah, it feels good to be nice people. It feels good to be generous when you give someone a nice tip at a restaurant and they get happy like that feels good. Like it's good for you to like, it's not just a one-way Street what kind of selfishness although it's not be calculated. If it's really that I just do exactly as much that gets me gratitude and recognition and the other people see through that writes. And so the Paradox is that it's kind of got to be sincere for to be credible to someone else. Yeah most effective way to prove to someone else that you're a nice guy is actually being nice guy with a pretty good pretty good into the psychologist who are always going to be really mean it is he just kind of kissing up is he trying to get you know, Curry favors and we see through that the person who Actually isn't doing that calculation that we really admire and respect right and then it's very unusual. It's one of the reasons why we admire like look at this, but it completely altruistic person. Yeah, I like it that the marketplace of reputations kind of selects can select for True niceness goodness. Yes, you got enough information enough interactions crude analogy. So the business world you can have Cutthroat fly-by-night businesses that just trying to squeeze everything out of the customers and then your take off as soon as they discovered there a little after a long way to actually make a lot of money. It's often the companies that will take back the product. No questions asked even if they lose a little bit of money, but they are in the Loyalty of their customers. Those are the companies that often do the best and stick around the longest. Yes to the way that being honorable. Even if you have little losses did a little bit more for him than he did for me. But over the long run. That's what makes you dizzy. Terrible at some other people want to hang out with if the reputations can scan spread. Yeah. It's kind of amazing. If you think about how cherished true generosity and kindness how cherish they are. Like it's it's an amazing thing like that. You see people that are truly kind and truly generous and we've we value that so much it's kind of amazing aren't more of them because they are such a virtue that we admire and you you if someone does behave in that manner, like people gravitate towards them. It's like it's a real trait that is attractive to people and there's a misunderstanding of The evolutionary explanation of the of appearance of altruism and generosity. I had a misunderstanding of the message that Dawkins conveyed in that book that predicts that we're all just kind of calculating favorite Raiders that we do just enough to get a favor in return. We don't think someone can help us in return. Then we just cut him off kind of cynical view of generosity, but it's actually the reason that that's not true is that as soon as the game begins you kind of get to higher and higher levels of eat people sucking each other out seeing through them cuz it's if I have a choice between who I'm going to hang out with who's going to be friend. There's one person is going to do exactly for what for me what will help him in the long run. There's someone else who's really is generous and he's really going to help me and he said he's not going to keep a long memory of who did what for whom I got to pick the second guy Brian. So he's going to actually be better off for being a better person now that you can take that to an extreme in the predicted means that we're all infinitely generous, which of course we're not and so this kind of trade-off equilibrium between you're not being a total sucker or not giving so much away that you just don't harm yourself in the long run and being the kind of person who is generous and honest and after other people, Want to affiliate with them and the reality is that all of us are probably mixtures. I mean, we're not Cutthroat sociopaths most of us some of us are nor are we are totals st. Self-sacrificing sings somewhere between a different people are different points in a Continuum. When you look at social media and you look at this this the the nastiness that's so common and obviously in some ways. It's got to be connected to the ability to be anonymous but I feel like I thought of this more and more lately that this negativity is is a probably a temporary thing. I feel like people are realizing that this is an unnatural way of communicating in that it's so relatively relatively recent in human history in such a small window. I mean 1994 is essentially when people start getting online and here we are in 2018 and you're seeing people switching to flip phones. You're deleting their Facebook that it's a very common thing and almost as Sheik thing to do. I got to go talking about it on a regular basis all man. Yeah. I just get email. I check it once a day and that's it. That's right when there's whenever there's a new technological innovation it take Society while to adjust to it. I didn't give you some people got a line in 1994 with social media reason more recent than that. It's more probably like that was smart phones started becoming ubiquitous on maybe 2011 and Facebook took off in the 2000s and similar things happened in when other media were introduced like a pig Panic on television came in that families would never talk to each other they'd all be is staring at the screen like zombies and you never have a conversation with the dinner table ever again, even before that were telephones were invented. It was families would never sit down together, cuz the phone constantly be ringing and attention spans would be disrupted because the phone could ring anytime. Conversation my books and about right and going back to the ancient Greeks wear when when writing was considered to be kind of generation decadent because see how you can you let your memory go to pot to the old how how are people going to cultivate their memory pay cash write things down and look at them. That's crazy. Is that interesting? Why do you think we're always looking to dismiss some new Fantastic technology beforehand a lot of what happens in a society is there like hundreds of little adjustments that people make like not spend too much time on Facebook or email and leave this platform for that platform where if you're starting from scratch and ask her can imagine how it's going to play out. You can really anticipate these things. It's like thousands of adjustments that people make they happy. When they happened with millions of people making decisions, but you can't just reduce them for hands like a logical proof. And so we just don't know we know what the threat is. We don't know what societies response is going to be when it comes to social media and just the human interaction because this is so new and because it's Uncharted Territory.

I mean, I think this is one of the reasons why so many people have so many concerns about it. Like, where is this? Where is this going like what's going to do to our children? We walk down the street and everyone's just staring at their phone. But it really is I said this that imagine there was a drug that came along that this drug made you only think about the drug you were you were likely more likely to get into car accidents because this drug you are more likely to sleep late cause more anxiety and in soak up immense amounts of your time with very little reward for it. Even though wow kind of crazy drugs. This is robbing people of their lives. That's cell phones if that's social media, I mean, It does give you something. I mean, if you use it correctly most of the time I try to spend on social media. I try to spend or most of time on on my phone when I try to spend off social media, but reading thing I tried to read articles and I tried it. I started in some way justify like, oh I'm doing something productive on my phone put in a lot of ways. I'm just addicted to checking that thing develop habits of self-control and balance in life. I had as soon as I heard and I'm a freshman came into my office and so she looks at Michelle for the books now Professor Pinker, how do you find time to write so many books and then she looks at my office and sees all the books on my shelves and still have time to read so many books. I think you're not on Facebook that comes out of those communities as well as the baby with the bathwater. And I sometimes look at my Twitter feed my learning really interesting stuff. I also say okay and I'll get back to work. Get back to reading go outside. Yeah, see some friends spend some time with with that with your family. Yeah, I will go down Twitter whole town Twitter hole yesterday about these Manu Mayan ruins that they found in Guatemala how amazing you have crazy thousands of structures swallowed up by time and they're just now realizing like, oh my God, this is City. Yeah. This is not getting the advantages and disadvantages. What's just so knew ya when you when you see all of us so much negativity though. And this is a big problem with Anonymous accounts in particular you seen in Facebook with button Facebook there seems to be repercussions. Like if your Tom Smith and Tom Smith write something horrible like Tom Smith could get fired from his job for Machine that people write something racist or sexist or whatever and we'll see them get fired from their job because of something that they put on Facebook because your profile represents the actual you not Anonymous. Yes. I feel like this benefit to that.

Yeah, that's right there. So maybe the problem is that can also be outraged mobs will post something and it's taken out of context and they didn't realize what he meant it as a joke. The woman who went to take to that trip to Africa self-effacing comment about racism and people thought it was racist, but she was actually making fun of races. I think she was drunk and she was being racist. I just know she was being funny because commute look I'm a comic and I have a lot of comedian friends that are not racist but they will say hilarious racist things because it's funny. It's not because they're racist. What was what was her name Justine Sacco? Thank you. I hope I don't get it, LOL. That's what she wrote. Stop at 12 hours later after a Xanax and wine hangover. I'm sure and her life is a living. Hell. Yeah, and she still to this day is so I mean Jamie knows our name racism Shadow, ironically. She meant it as a gas. Stove self was not racist if she become controversial after that as well or DraftKings is an online gambling thing. It's kind of controversial gambling on Sports and stuff like that. We look for people. Also we're talkin about this before without getting into details about who were talking about but there's certain people that are very flawed individuals that look to find people and attack them to take away some of the the spotlight on their own flaws. Absolutely. This is a this is a big part of virtue signaling right like a big part of going after people an outrage Moss as long as the mob is attacking someone. They're not attacking you. Okay, that's right. Yeah, that's right. I'm interesting question over history is very popular delusions and The Madness of crowds tulip bulb Mania in Holland in the seventeenth Century people start to outbid each other on tulip bulbs and 30 price of a single tulip bulb went like through the roof and then it suddenly crash people lost fortunes cuz everyone was expecting everyone else to keep building up the price but their balls of sinking a ship or causing a crop failure or making someone's child get sick. They're the pogroms in Europe were Jews were accused of poisoning. The wells are killing Christian boys to make matzo out of their blood. Lynchings in the American South where African-Americans were accused of raping a woman and based on just a rumor spreading and then they'd be tortured and hanged is McCarthy era. They were devastated the daycare Satanic ritual abuse of the 1980s wear these daycare workers were accused basically by coaching kids to embellish these fantastic stories how they were sexually molested and tortured and forced to take part in Satanic rituals in all totally nonsense and went to jail how do people lose their Collective Minds it every once in awhile in history and part of the answer is if you start a a kind of vicious circle of denouncing people and then denouncing people who don't denounce people announcing people who call the whistle on another people dancing people that you can get. Hey, I kind of Circle of Terror where no one want. Everyone is so afraid of being denounced that they wanted to know its first Soviet Union is another example, I'm hours China and then somehow someone the way switch dictators could often forced air Power by have the training the citizens against each other. So everyone's denouncing everyone else out of fear that they'll be denounced first that's going on right now in North Korea, right? Absolutely North Korea. They have this thing where they each have to report on each other like when people are together. They were poured on each other for different things that they did that were violations of whatever code they follow absolutely and so governments know how to explain it but it isn't just got home and said could happen spontaneously to some weird human trade, isn't it is it's a combination of a kind of human trait on a kind of dynamic when you have the kind of a network of people and they all are are going to trapped and no one could be the first person to escape from this Vicious Circle because they don't want to be the one who is Denounced it imprisoned and tortured or whatever the consequence maybe what do you think? Where do you think if you think at all about this? Where do you think this is a headed like especially in terms of social media and recognition of the problem that we will mount a response that it'll seem ridiculous the outrage mob once it's recognized that there are outraged mobs in virtue signaling Fanatics. Once we have a label for them. Once we know that it's a thing seemed so ridiculous that people will be less tempted to do it. And that's the optimistic come all this is such a flaw in their there's a real issue and writing things at one of the issues, especially if you're writing about a subject where there's a lot of people involved or perhaps and even an individual is that you're the only one that's right it like if you were having a conversation with that purse. They would be able to say something back like you'd be able say something and it will go. Well, that's not exactly how I was thinking I actually was looking at this way and the other person so will your take on it was go back and forth and exchange information. Hopefully come to some sort of an understanding of what's going on in each person's mind. Absolutely right as you can Define someone in a tweet or in a Facebook post for a blog post. You can Define someone without them having any ability to respond in the moment. So you have this hold uninterrupted chunk where you could you know, talk about in a fill-in-the-blank some celebrity or some politician or whatever and you can Define them and some really horrible nasty way and they just have to sit there and read it like it is just your thoughts but not an accurate method of communicating ideas with a person it's just your one. Uninterrupted take on things. Absolutely. So I might my second to last book the one just before my my current book Enlightenment now, but the previous book was called the sense of style and was awaiting manual it is I said, why is so much were writing so bad. How come there's so much writing where you just can't understand what the person is talking about. And I I mentioned some fiery some people think that it's your academics and intellectuals trying to show off how profound AR my how I'm King comprehensible. They are people can understand it can't be that complicated. So I'm really smart. But I think that the main theory is that that writing is as you just as you described it's a one-way channel of communication is very unnatural. We speak you and I were having conversation. We're looking each other in the eye and our eyebrows go up and they get needed and if I say if I start to become too obscure, you're going to give me a quizzical lawn mower. Terrified expression on their face value in a sense of style is to become a kind of enough of an intuitive psychologist that you can try to anticipate what your reader knows and what your reader doesn't know and that it because you have no way of determining that as your writing cuz you're just sitting there being tapping away. Whoever is going to read what you write. You never going to beat them. They might be three years from now, there might be halfway across the world and it's just one way and so and there's another a kind of psychological problem that we all have. It's just part of being human called The Curse of knowledge mainly when you know something it's really really hard to imagine what it's like not to know it you just assumed that everyone knows that you're you're you're understanding is everyone so understanding and so you right away and it never cursed you. Fat the reader doesn't know your abbreviations or your jargon or can't visualize what you're describing it. Just so clear to you the writer and a lot of bad writing comes from the curse of knowledge that is right or not getting into the heads of sweeter. And a lot of a cure is either to at least know that it's a problem and think of what can I read it be reasonably expected to know because we're not even that good at fast. I mean, none of us are mind readers just showing someone a draft of what you've written and you're often surprised at how often they'll say. I don't know what you're talking about. A man should we should force people to do at Twitter maybe should have legs and a team of people that you send your Tweet to yes circle of confidants. Will that mean you got an attitude? Right? And I could eat you got Pure review before it's published. They send it out to other people just like you and they they they might hurt a little review and you got to modify it if it doesn't make any sense, right? So Justine Sacco it sent Got to a team of Confidant it wouldn't know is I steam show except don't fight that I'm sorry. I'm going to play and I'm drunk. Well, this is what our big themes in my my new book Enlightenment now is how is it simultaneously many ways getting smarter but also seem to be getting stupid. Why do you say it a part of it? Is that smart? We all are cognitive psychologists have shown that humans have all kinds of biases and fallacies. We we we reason from stereotypes we assess Risk by how easy it is to imagine something so it were afraid of getting on a plane cuz it's very easy to imagine a plane crashing and Pluto plane crashes make the news. We don't worry about texting while driving because there's never a headline on page one of a hundred people who died in the past week because they texted while driving a lot of fallacies amazing things. Do all car seats are amazing and it's because none of us solve the problem all by ourselves what part of our kind of collective brain that works by rules where all of the excesses of one person get kind of balanced out by up by other people and that's why you have no things like checks and balances in a democracy where instead of having a supreme leader who just runs the country the way he wants he's got to worry about the legislature and the courts and the judges and you know, and an impeachment and so on and science instead of having one genius announcing the way the world works. We are here she has to Subjecting self to peer review and get let out of science is criticize criticize him and her and whatever you get people acting intelligent way. It's often because they belong to these institutions with rules that are designed to make up for the idiocies of any individual person. That's fascinating that makes so much sense. I've also felt that there's not a lot vintage not that we have difficulties obviously people have difficulties in this life or social difficulties economic difficulties, but when in terms of survival difficulties, it's it's way easier to get by today than it has ever been in human history, and I wonder if Human beings have a need for adversity and complexity and problem-solving and all these things that are less. They're they're less present today than ever before. I think things are just almost too simple with made it to ease weave Nerf the world. It's been in doing so it's easier to just kind of be dumb minded and drift through and follow the herd the heart is so big and there's so many people in the hurt if you just do what most the people are doing where what most of the people are wearing say the things most of the people say you'll survive and you'll survive and you'll find some other dim-witted person to breed with and you'll make them would have children and I'm being dead serious. I think there's a certain when you're dealing with this massive pack Cubs Youmans 300-plus million on a continent. There's just there's so much.

If you have a group of people, if you're being very generous and you have a hundred people in a row, what are the odds that one of those people is a moron its 100% That one is going to be more on that leaves you with 3 million morons United States of America. If you're being really kind and 3 million Jesus. Yes. My book is cuz it is often described as a book on optimism Enlightenment now because I have 75 graphs almost all of it show the world getting better including people figure the most incredible graph of the book on a phenomenon called the Flynn effect, which is that believe it or not. But I know most people do not IQ scores have been rising for most of the last hundred years, but three points a decade now this I know it seems totally unbelievable. But yet they discovered it when Flynn a philosopher discovered it when he realized that the people who make IQ tests had to keep me Norming, the tests to keep a hundred as the average because the average kept creeping up and was like 310 why we keep that that's what most people score we say that the average adjust the scale. They keep doing this over and over again that must mean the population is getting smarter now not biologically smarter. It's not that people's brain power. Somehow magically been increasing probably a little bit of that through better nutrition better sanitation and health care and so on but a lot of it is just that a lot that ideas that used to be kind of sophisticated and restricted to professors and scientists and statisticians going to trickle down to the population. And so we things like a placebo effect or trade off or cost-benefit analysis or win-win situation. All these things actually came from pretty fancy schmancy Theory originally, but that kind of List of the whole population and they become part of everyone's conventional wisdom. Also, we have to think more and more and Abstract ways just to deal with things like a subway map on a smartphone watching TV and turn on the kind of program the bloody thing. So the demands of life it become more sophisticated and ideas spread more quickly. And so we are quite literally getting smarter up to a point things that can't go on forever. Don't and the Flynn effect is starting to level off but that has been this this this drift upward and intelligence. I don't think that's surprising at all. I think that if you look at the amount of information that people are subject to today and just did the sheer Rod data mean there's a lot of the data is just nonsense and Twitter and that wanted what is the quote that we produce more content in two days than an entire human history every two days something crazy like that. Is that right? LOL, I just went to the mall with the sheer amount of interesting information like those newly discovered Mayan ruins in Guatemala and things along those lines or do you know something there was some interesting new information on the history of human beings cuz they found some new teeth and some other throwback to the date of modern humans and they keep moving that by which the point is we're constantly getting more information and more data more things to think about and I've just got to assume that the amount of information that comes to a person in 2018 is just vastly larger than the amount that came to them in 1978 absolute lie, and there are and no as idiotic as a lot of public debate is today. There's a lot of idiocy in the past. I mean in the 1960s Interracial couple in Virginia where there's a court judge who said God didn't mean for the racist intermarry. That's why he put black people in Africa and yellow people in Asia and white people in Europe loving versus Virginia that stupid an argument today even even people that we think of us as kind of racist. They be embarrassed to stupid people on the on the left made some pretty stupid arguments as well. When Castro I sent all of the gay people to concentration camps in Cuba, you had Susan Sontag our respective left-wing intellectual who sang. Well, this is you got to forgive them because Latin America was such a sexualized culture and they were prostitutes and they will stack it instead. Of course. It's a little bit of an overreaction. Unit today. I don't think anyone on the left or the right would say it's okay to send gay people to concentration. She's right because they were a lot of prostitutes in Havana but that the kind of idiotic statement that we kind of forget that people used to make in the past 2 so we are you showing ourselves whenever we see the debate getting sing we getting stupider and stupider. Got to remember your stupidity in the past two. Oh, yeah and tell day by day, especially when your attention is concentrated by the worst things that happen in the Guinness a big theme of of Enlightenment now that your picture of the world when it's because the human mind really is driven by anecdotes and images of stories and that's what the news gives us. But if you look at Trends to follow the trend lines not the headlines you seen it a lot of things really are getting better gradually, but that accumulates over time and what are the things that with the flow of information we are actually getting more we meeting Americans. Also worldwide there is trying to getting more liberal more tolerant more Progressive your heart to tell day by day. But when you think that in the 1960s, there was a debate over whether they should be racial segregation by there African Americans should drink at a different cup water fountains or stay in different motels. There's debate over whether women should should be allowed in the workplace that what's going to happen to all the kids if they are all working gay people should be allowed to be teachers and we've kind of Forgotten these because the progressive side kind of one and the debate has moved on and that happens worldwide. Ask Peep has information flows as people start to meet each other as ideas proliferate. There. Is this gradual Trend toward more a tolerance in parts of the world where it seems to be totally absent like a lot of the Islamic World which World survey show. This is the least Progressive part of the world in Is attitudes towards women attitudes towards gays how to switch to a child rearing has been adrift in the liberal direction. We just saw two weeks ago when Saudi Arabia allowed women to dry world really did drag them kicking and screaming out of the Middle Ages in this in this way and that kind of tends to happen over the long run an optimist and I really do look at all those Trends yo-yo you like the book that song 575 optimistic grass. So excellent. I yeah, I think that if we look at just the overall human rights and one of the best into indications that is going to look at media representations of life from the 1950s and 1960s watch movies, especially from the 50s and it just see how people behave and it's either you're getting sort of a timestamp. Of human interaction from 1950s. He's obviously an artistic representation of a time does until that time but you get a sense of how people thought it was. Okay to behave there was a lot of smacking women. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, really Comedy Movies Ranch and children. Remember the scene where it or Junior would misbehave and mom would say wait till your father gets home and then dad comes home and pull the belt out of his pants so you can use as a weapon. So yeah, Michael would really hurt the child and the child would be no time. Yeah. I know now you call social services take a child away or something. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think this idea of being dragged Kicking and Screaming into this new age. I think we're all doing that and I think you're seeing that in so many different parts of our culture today. And I think that's one of the things that's happening with this me-too movement. Is it all this this Mass public shaming of sexual harass? Pictures of sexual assaulters in August everything it's like forcing human beings to reassess the way they interact with each other and like this really rackel very quick sort of a movement over just a short. Of time. Is that a giant impact on culture? Yeah, and and like a lot of social changes it it happens really quickly Now remix has some good things and it's really good that men have no longer have a license to just expose themselves or or harass women who work for them. Yes treat them cruden and the Ugly waste. I know there's also a legitimate concern that you just can't really believe you all accusers send any kind of learned that through history from from from witch hunts and lynchings and that programs and there's got to be proportionality not all infractions are all the same punishment should fit the crime. So we haven't quite settled in had a bath. Unsteady very necessary corrective to two men harassing women with the rule of law and standards of Justice from wrong about this or this is one of my fairies is a we our brains are capacity in our understanding is relative to what's necessary at the time and I want two things that I use is dunbar's number. So that dunbar's number is this idea that you could only have these intimate relationships with a hundred and fifty or so people or in in terms of intimacy of understanding who they are knowing their name knowing things about them. But as our circle of people that we interact with grows and expands, I wonder if that's going to expand as well. When you think about the amount of information that people can hold in their brain and what people are used to knowing about this is a radically different world in 2018 than it was in 1960 the amount of things that you were aware of it. 1860 just by virtue of not having social media the internet Google all these of these different ways you can get information from it's just so different. I mean it's but I don't know what how many times more information you're getting but it must be much more. Yes and over and Incredibly small. Of time. When you think about the, you know, the relative time span of a human beings have been here too few hundred thousand years or whatever. I wonder if this is I wonder what changing and I wonder what it what we're going to be like if this continues to grow and continues to be a part of our life this if we're going to adapt our abilities. Well, if we can't I change the biological structure of the brain in a very much because even though we all learned through our lives there are limits to what I can do, but what happens if there's a back and forth between our brains and the Technologies the technology adjusts to take into account how how the cow brains work. So they feed the Restriction if I can't know or feel that, you know more than a hundred a hundred fifty people that's helps to find the top-ranked friends in a social network are the fact that were visual creatures, you know, we're primates will we get a lot of our information to our eyeballs? It's one of the reasons why Technology has changed so much since the 80s and 70s when I first learned to program a computer. It was just all text and use a computer and they're just 80 characters in a line and you have those letters of the alphabet and that's all there was and it soon became clear that that's not a very efficient way of getting ideas into a brain. It's really laborious and tiring until you have graphic user user interfaces. Apple was the first to commercialize it but it's been developed beforehand. It is Xerox. It is really exotic at first when you saw a screen with these Windows 7 pointers and icons in a mouse and computers don't work that way. Naturally. You took a huge amount still got it takes a huge amount of programming to get a computer to pretend that there's a sheet of paper on the screen, but that because we're visual creatures the technology adapted so that we could feel comfortable using it so some of it is, how much do we adjust to the technology and how much? Is the technology forced to adjust us thinking in terms of the actual capability of the human mind and when you read about the modern human brain, it was an article that was published recently that was trying to read map the timeline of the modern human brain and I think they were pointing to about 35,000 years ago now and see if you find that trying to figure out what exactly they're saying, but essentially they were saying that the human the modern human brain was far more recent into a trust a game not surprised. Yeah. Well, I would have guessed a little bit older than that. But yeah, but you only the tens of thousands of years. Yeah. So what did one of the big mystery is right is the doubling of the human brain size over. Of what is like 2 million years, isn't this something had to happen to cause that like some change in our environment some change in her behavior and what has been a bigger change in the internet like what is been a bitter bigger change in the app? Information of people have today and I'm wondering if like, we're not experiencing when you talk about these Rises steady rise of IQs. Obviously, it's not just the internet station that you move of data that people just keep piling on two and more people are more things and people get wiser. And you know, the way we interface with information is better than it's ever been before but I wonder about the capacity and the capabilities of the human mind if it's happening right now. It's just a very gradual thing this 10% tick or ten point tick per per decade. If this is going to lead you extrapolate you go a hundred years from now to hundred years from now, we what are we going to be looking at 2? I mean, well the thing is that what happened over the last few tens of thousands of years. It is not going to be replicated anytime soon because that was driven by Darwin natural selection with just meant that smarter people have more surviving babies. That's a process that happened. That's a speed limit measured in generations, and it's May not be that coping in a modern society makes you have more babies map me to go around bright eyes and I should more educated you have fewer children. And so I think a lot of bee did they going to be a certain amount of plasticity of what you can master in your own life time, especially if you start with a childhood you're going to a lot of these skills become second nature how to look things up how to how to use these devices efficiently and then that we can we can reach when it's only so many hours in the day and there's only so many neurons in your brain but in conjunction with all the technology becomes more human friendly and their new ways of getting information into the brain, you know, as I mentioned we've gone from just lines of characters to graphic user interfaces and video and more creative datagraphics where you see moving colored graphs as a way of getting a bunch of variables into a human head more. Add virtual reality might be the next step where we got 3D environments that we can explore and that may be a way of getting our puny brains to experience more information. Yeah. I was going to bring that up teen ass cuz that's one of the things that concerns me the most is how good virtual reality is now but how relatively crude it is in comparison to the potential then. Have you experienced it all of you use like an HTC Vive or any of those kind of lower-tech kinds of cardboard and interests. I just don't. Yeah, but the vibe will freak you out. There's a there's one of things and I I used several years ago as version. I think my friend Duncan Trussell have one two or three years ago that I used and I was blown away by that where you're underwater and there's a whale that swims up to you and you know, and it seems so real and it's just get nauseous. I didn't but it was in it is but it's obviously fake like I'm looking at it and I can make a distinction quickly like when you see a movie and in the movie, there's like fake dogs or something like that. I take monsters like it's fake thing. It's it's fake that but it's really good fake and I can recognize it as a fake, but I was like why what is going to be like in 10 years? What is going to be like in 30 years is going to be and how much better is the interface going to be a I'm really concerned that there's going to be a just a giant section of our population that completely checks out of the regular world and lives in some strange Fantasyland most of the time they just consume food and water and figure out a way to feed themselves and spend most of their time locked into a helmet living in some fantastic artificial environment that people have created Became popular right before that would movies the question of what kind of balance people will will find. Chloe is going to be more physically what you describe people do people who like reality to hire people huge numbers go to the national parks. Yeah. I was just seeing the same thing and people care whether and when they buy work hard to care whether it's real or fake, there's one part of the human mind bad as much as were seduced by just sensual sensory experiences. We also had a sense of reality we value it and you know, we don't like being fooled too much and the question is what balance do we find between the desire for authentic experience and the pleasure of these cheap artificial ones when you chose to write a book about Enlightenment and you chose to write a book The showing all these positive graphs and all these trends that seem to be optimistic are you riding that? Obviously you feel this way and this is the data and this is your interpretation of where we're headed buddy. Are you also kind of like encouraging people in a way to have them or rose-colored view of the world and just yeah, I understand exactly but kind of problem solving mindset namely we have solved problems in the past. At least we've we produce them and that I think involves us to look the problems we have now and think what we can handle those two if we decide to do now what our ancestors did in the past that led in the right directions and I I credit this to the mindset of the Enlightenment namely that with reason and Science and a concern for human welfare, we can gradually make people better off as long as we maintain the philosophy of of of whipping then we eat then there's a reasonable hope that we can solve the problems facing us. It doesn't happen by itself is not a magic escalator. There's no Art history or dialectic mystical stuff. It just makes us better and better.

Bears recognizing problems and figuring out how the world works and doing our best to solve that was that was the message in the fact that we have had progress contrary to the impression to get from headlines shows that this is not a crazy idealistic optimistic pipedream. It's happened to end to morfa can happen if that's where I was going with this is that why do we have this desire to concentrate on the negative? Like I have a friend my friend Ian Edwards has his bit about the news about renaming it to the bad news is on this whole rant about the news is it because we have this cancer like we have to recognize danger and we want to know what's happening so that we know that we're safe, but the reality is we're dealing with a world of 7 billion people with 7 billion stories, you know, so You're going to be able to see negative stuff all day long. If you so choose to do that. If you so choose to concentrate on negativity and it gives you this bizarre portrait of the world that the world is this horrible place and Bill Hicks used to have a bit about CNN about you watching CNN Adobe death age pitbulls you go outside birds are chirping, which where's all this should happen if there's a lot to that that's why it doesn't great great examples. Why do we concentrate our desire to concentrate only on the negative or mostly on the negative in Psychology call the negativity bias that bad is psychologically stronger than good. So we'd rather we'd read losses more than we enjoy gains and criticism hurts much more than praise makes you feel better. Where are our our minds are attracted to possibilities of of death in danger and so on. I think it's because we are really As you say we are vulnerable there many more things that could go wrong man can go right and that's kind of a implication of the law of entropy. There's a tiny fraction of the way of the world can work that works works out well for you in an awful lot of ways of things can go wrong and so our minds are attuned to things that can go wrong and that opens up a market for experts to remind us of things that can go wrong that we may have forgotten and so that the news tends to gravitate to the negative and they're actually studies that show this you give editors two different framing's of an event an optimistic one of the pessimistic one pessimistic one that's actually increased. I have a graph in the book 1 of 75 grafts. It shows an automatic analysis of the tone of the News That's how often are there positive words like you don't improve better how often the negative words like Crisis disaster catastrophe the news we getting more and more negative for about 70 years. Is it uniform on both sides right and left? Good question. I don't know the answer. I suspect it is but I don't know what I don't know the answer for sure. There are fluctuations their ups and downs, but overall even though the other graphs on the bookshelves in reality. The world is actually getting better. There fewer deaths from war. There's fewer homicides were making some progress in in pollution. There's less poverty than they used to be more education. But the news is we getting more and more morose journalism that to be responsible as to point out. What's going wrong. What one editor said good good news isn't news. It's advertising and it's also because of the time scale that it's very easy to destroy something really quickly. I mean something blows up and that's news improvements tend to be gradual day by day and there's never a Thursday in March in which something happens that gives as as Max Roser Tucanos propoint up. Newspapers could run a headline hundred thirty-eight thousand people escaped from extreme poverty yesterday every day for the last 30 years that they never ran a headline even once because there's never a particular day in which the hotter than 38,000 people were different than 130,000 people the day before and so the lot of good things kind of creep up on us and they're never reported in headlines. Whereas it's easy to blow something up and then it does happen on a Thursday. So you have a very positive view of the future of humans. Well, it's the great time Swedish Chef eye doctor in TED Talks start Hans rosling put it when he was asked are you an optimist? He said I'm not an optimist. I'm a very serious possible list of the future. It depends on what we do now that there are real threats and dangers show us. There's a possibility of nuclear war. There's a possibility of catastrophic climate change so we can't Sit back and say well things have gotten better. Let's let him continue by sheer inertia and momentum that's not going to happen. But what it does indicate is well, we Face crises in the past and I we we have meetings better. Let's figure out how to do with a crises now. That's a great way of looking at it to be realistic about it because the possibility of positive things is a real that's real. But also there's a reason why we find those ruins in Guatemala people are there anymore I mean driving culture thousands of structures and now it's a jungle like what happened to the difference between modern all modern societies and all of the ones that the did collapse after the enlightenment. We developed a kind of a scientific Networking Community who developed the habit of free speech and open debate and keep an accumulation of information in written and electronic records. It is not the same now doesn't mean that were out of danger because we've created new dangerous in a life like nuclear war like climate change, but there is a mechanisms in place if we concentrate them if we are determined to keep doing it then then there's a reasonable expectation of success again, but not automatically we got to decide to me we got to make those choices you have the history of the human race is so weird in terms of the rise and fall of the civilizations and cultures that we're always at least I am always looking at like what what how long is this going to last? Like, how long is this one particular Nation going to keep it together? And if you look at how many different countries have been around that just how many? Yeah with the dominant cultures Rome Princeton just now. It's just Italy. It's just a normal. You know, what's a good normal European country that used to be this conquering Nation? How long can we kind of keep this thing up? And what are your thoughts on that the future of of just even the idea of Nations? It seems like our bow our boundaries are borders of the way. We have online this ability to communicate with people all over the place everywhere. It seems to me to lessen the necessary for the need rather for four borders and four for these walls that we're now literally and figuratively talking about putting up a balanced interesting thing about nation-states now is that they are treated as a mortal at that most of History. And Nations missions were wiped off the map and and gulfton Concord and you're now you look at a map of the world and it's actually not that different from what it was 70 years ago. I mean are colonies that achieved Independence. There's some big States like Soviet Union that fragmented but the borders in between the Soviet republics are now borders between nation-states and no nation has gone out of existence through Conquest since I had since 1945 at least recognize internationally-recognized state by the by the UN, so this is Norm even though the borders are often crazy arbitrary lines drawn a map. But one of the reasons that against counterintuitive Wars have gone down and debts and wasn't going down is that borders and are treated as sacrosanct. By the International Community. 100% of the time you had Russia Annex in Crimea, but those are exceptions by and large unlike saying the past in the 19 century where the US had a an unpaid debt from Mexico. So it conquered is no Texas and Colorado and kick Nevada and California near that doesn't happen anymore. And so does grandfathered-in and that's one of the reasons why they feed the world has been more stable in terms of the year that the map as he mentioned. There's another sense in which we have this Global Community the track transcends borders. We have things like the European Union. We have the United Nations. We have a trade agreements like NAFTA which try to get simultaneously the grandfather borders, but this extra layer of cooperation that transcends the borders and we need them more and more despite the fact that our our our current president is pushing back against Global Community because there are problems that are global migration terrorism climate pollution Rogue States and the fact that people even if they've even if you grew up in France and you consider yourself a French citizen you want to be able to spend the summer in Italy or in England or Belgium if that's where there's a good job and there's a desire on people to be able to move to wherever the opportunities are best. There's going to be some kind of compromise I think between Keeping with the theme nation state borders just so you don't have constant Wars of conquest and Border disputes, but allowing the world and allowing the people of the world that take advantage of a true Global Community. Yeah, I feel like that's one of the things that people are most upset about brexit was that this is even though they the people that were Pro brexit felt like this was in the interest of the UK in the interest of England to be separate from all this because they were doing better and because they didn't want all the negative possibilities from all these other places coming into their environment, but What would I think that people what they didn't like about it was the idea that this is a regressive move and that the progressive move is that we would all move towards this idea of the global community of this in entire world being free and connected and you know, we've talked about some of the problems that Paris has with the immigration. We showed some of the videos of these these immigrants had just littered all over the street and taking this place apart. We're looking at it going man that is that is a real tragedy, but What it represents is a bunch of people that really don't have anything like the real tragedy is that these people live like this is a real tragedy is not that they've done it to Paris. The real tragedy is that these people exist at all, and if they moved to Paris looking for a better life and now there is stuck in the situation we're now there's not a lot of Sanitation the garbage is all over the place. They're littering everywhere and it's I wonder if we ever will have a world where there isn't a place where you can go and ship a factory and pay people $2 an hour because they don't need a dollar an hour because it's just like living in Los Angeles or just like living in Phoenix, like you'd never be able to pay someone $2 an hour because it's too much opportunity that the world has caught up and surpassed it. Yeah, I've been at their number of really complicated issues that they are Mobility is generally a good thing in countries do well when they welcome immigrants, but you're not Short-term not too many too fast you faster than they can be assimilated and integrated into the new country. So it just opening the doors right? Probably is not a good idea. No country really does that by building wall. Is it a terrible idea to and of course the best way to prevent your massive amounts of migration is to make life better in the Country Squire, right that is happening slowly and evenly but it's been noted that even United States in Mexico more people are going to the same number of people are doing the reverse migration from the US back to Mexico. Now that the economy of Mexico so much my own parents 25 years. Okay heart attack, but there is a huge Improvement in the standard of living in what used to be called the third world the developing world where Levi's teeth look at the cutoff for extreme poverty kind of dafont divine summer arbitrarily is a dollar. Ninety per person per day kind of a bare bare bare minimum to feed feed your family. It's down now from 50% a few decades ago to 10% now and the United Nations except the goal of Bring It To Zero by the year 2030 and what street what is causing that what's causing the change? So a lot of it is globalization that haven't even though that's kind of a villain in many people's eyes. But when you have a huge Global Market then and the introduction of factories in industrialization in China and India and Bangladesh, sometimes the conditions are Grim, but the conditions being a peasant in the rice paddies was even Grimmer and when when you have people in the greater the economy selling their products on the world stage are they can get richer and so a lot also better policies. We have governments that Are no longer communist or really heavy-handed forms of socialism with everything is defined by the bureaucrats and you need 50 licenses to do anything and you have a little bit more economic flexibility that tends to make countries richer. I doesn't mean that you could do away with regulations on workplace safety and the end environment as countries get richer. They tend to be more protective of their workers. And if the environment right hand leaders that I think of their mandate as how do I get my country to be richer the most dramatic cases China where your mile have these harebrained schemes of huge Collective Farms people smelting iron in their backyards and do anything in the middle of the night. He would force on hundreds of millions of people across these massive famines. Then you ding ding Zhao Peng took over. He said getting rich is good and he said black White Cap Plaza catches mice it's a good cat food much more pragmatic much more concerned with the welfare of their citizens when you have leaders who have that mindset than that their country can can I get get welfare and their citizens better off? Now but are you concerned mean I did I agree with you that it is probably as one of the reasons why these people are experiencing this greater quality of life is because of globalization because he's factories moving in but they're living lives that are very different than maybe perhaps it's by our standards that their lives are better that maybe if they're these indigenous people were living the sort of subsistence lifestyle that even though on paper they would be existing in extreme poverty. But if there was perhaps like living in the jungle or somewhere along those lines where you have access to all these natural resources and even though they be living in extreme poverty, they'd be living maybe perhaps even a better life by just eating the fish and eating the plants and and hunting and fishing and doing what they have normally done for thousands and thousands of years rather than making a dollar-an-hour Nike Factory indigenous peoples who are living in Unturned. Lifestyles that there are real real crime scene just placing them off and not So Much by factories, but by Miners and loggers by feet the there a very tiny fraction of the world's population in a tragically the vast majority of poor people are more our peasants not a cultural Agricultural labourers and for them just based on the their own choices off in the factory life is a is an improvement. It's an improvement not just because they're not in the fields knee-deep in mock pulling up ceilings and getting a bitten by disease-carrying bugs, but for women being able to move from a village to City off of being The Liberation that they can start business in the kids to school be out from under the thumbs of their husbands and husbands family. They're kind of Liberation just just as what are ants our ancestors did when they left the forms for four cities 250 years ago. So you're not to say there is an exploitation and I am cruelty we ought to be a post and in the case of native peoples often are criminal at displacements. But on the whole globalization has led to this escape from grinding poverty for literally hundreds of millions of people. So even when they move the factories in to these places in charge or are our pay them a dollar-an-hour rather, it's still a dollar more an hour than they would have gotten if the factory had been there in many cases. That's true. We have a greater from Poland to Canada and I it often is a root word Mobility. Yeah, it's it's hard for us to accept that I don't even think about it that way because it was him a white. How come they don't have to pay these Mexican folks minimum wage just like they do in America. I like but why don't they have the same sort of setup that we do here just seems cruel right now. You ain't Berkeley or Manhattan.

It's the difference between working a factory there and we bring the fields there and the people are often given that choice they line up for the factory jobs. Do you anticipate a time where there is no third world and there is no such a massive economic disparity. It's it's conceivable. It's a ways off but it's happened in huge parts of the world. And we forget that places like South Korea Now Rich upper middle class Society. Long ago, that was the third world. I mean they were they were hungry. They were children died young living in squalor that was true to me in China last part places parts of China. Now that are are pretty much middle-class that were a squalid not so long ago. I Singapore I have an anecdote in the book Enlightenment. Now with my ex-mother-in-law who grew up in Singapore and she remembers our childhood meal in which her family split one egg for ways back in the 1940s Singapore is now one of the world's richest countries most remote poorest parts of the world are going to be the hardest to bring up to the middle class standards like your Congo like Haiti like Afghanistan, but a large parts of the world. There's been a huge increase in the standard of living. You talked recently about the dangers of overly politically correct? Thinking of just politically correct thinking of of a set of a rebound effect where politically correct thinking is actually causing more extremism or more radical thinking into in terms of response to that. I can overcorrection conversation. We talked about the differences that's being kind of taboo from polite company and it'll give another example of this is Kraken xur. This conversation isn't a lot of academe yet. There's just capitalism word liberalism and a certain percentage some surprisingly large percentage of academics are actually marxists probably about 15% in the social sciences and say the obvious fact Capitalism is better than communism in South Korea or North Korea live in the old East Germany or West Germany. I'd rather live now in Venezuela ordering chili and it's obvious that capitalism makes people richer and free air and better off in pretty much every way now that's a fact. It's almost over here now Academia, but if you say it by itself and suddenly people discover it for the first time that you can get the extreme right-wing position that any amount of Regulation is bad and the amount of social spending is bad. We need the most extreme form of almost anarcho-capitalism like radical libertarianism, and that's because I argue that if you never have a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of different economic systems, you never hear the arguments for why some mixture of a free Market with regulation of things that have to be regulated cuz the market won't take care of them like pollution mean the market just won't put up put a price on the atmosphere because no one owns the atmosphere and so having a combination of a free market with environmental regulations gives you the best of both worlds likewise social spending for the elderly for children for the sick for the Unlucky that's not incompatible with a free market. And in fact some of the countries with the strongest social safety nets also are the ones with the most economic freedom. So that argument that I've just given you right now just doesn't take place because there's such a commitment to the idea that capitalism is bad opening up the possibility that someone discovers hate capitalism isn't so bad. Then they read to them strongest possible conclusion. Well soon as you have social security and then we're going to be like Venezuela Venezuela or or or or or carbon pricing. And the rational way of organizing Society with just the right balance of free markets regulation social spending is just something that doesn't get discussed out in the open you get these polarized extreme internet. That's what it what's the origin of that thought process in Academia. Like why has capitalism in demon eyes and socialism being been praised despite all the evidence that especially Marxist socialism Marxism. It's just it's never been shown to be effective and it's been shown to be very dangerous. Yeah. That's a good question one Theory from Thomas Sowell Hoover institution. Is that like systems that where you can articulate a theory in a bunch of verbal propositions and then of the government implements them are there certain phenomena in in social life like market economies where the intelligence is distributed across millions of people don't actually knows how to make the system work, but people Make things look for buyers. They set the price where people will buy them and then over the entire Society things kind of work out but no one actually no single individual has the theory as to how that got to work. A language is another example, there's no committee that designed the English language has no theory of how the English language art to work. It's like hundreds of millions of people just talking and then that new slang and they slur and they emphasize and they borrow from other languages in the language changes and it works pretty well here. We are speaking English. So I think he was influenced by kayak Friedrich Hayek the Austrian economist. That systems of distributed intelligence where no one genius ever designed it but millions of people cooperating give rise to a collective intelligence kind of run against the grain of the way intellectuals often. Think of course, you could do what high I canceled it and realize there is this phenomenon of collective intelligence. But if your first impulse is what's the theory you're one of the set of principles that you going to gravitate to planned your hyper plan systems and be a little bit of livius to distributed system in Academia for whatever reason looking at things in terms of from a social standpoint looking at things that is a distribution of wealth is the big common subject to keep getting brought up and class structures that there's going to be a time if everything works out correctly if we How to evolve our culture where we will no longer have classes will know and we'll be able to distribute wealth completely equally across the board but it's sort of denying the the motivation that human beings have to succeed. It's designed the denying this desire that people have to stand out and to overachieve or two to get to be an outlier in terms of performance, which is just a natural part of human beings and also competition that competition it is fueled by reward and without competition. You don't have iPhone. You don't have most of the technological innovation that we have the wood that's been funded by these companies have done it in order to make money. If this kid there's got to be some sort of a reason why they pushed all these things. It's so ironic when someone is talking about how capitalism sucks on an iPhone that is one of the more bizarre ironies that is Unexposed you put your finger in my book the blank slate. I also discussed that part of it is sometimes called social Darwinism wasn't it had nothing to do with Darwin ironically, but the idea that the only way societies progresses through ruthless Cutthroat competition and poor people are just Dragon species down and screw them and and if we before we were bleeding hearts, then we'll retard the progress of society. We need to get everyone against everyone else for 2 to advance that that's really not a very good way to organize a society but it's such a reaction against that in the twentieth century that you got the opposite extreme that we are all blank slates. That is we all start off identical and that any kind of competition is bad you need if it's the benevolent government to distribute everything in the fairest possible manner. Now the reality is going to is something in between we are there's going to be any quality in any Fair system simply because some people really are smarter than others and some people have more discipline and more self-control and and it's good to harness that so that our competitive impulses have some people burning the midnight oil and racking my brain stew how to make things better off cuz they anticipate some rewards you don't want to sap all incentives, which is kind of what happened in the Soviet Union. He also don't want a Central Committee to decide that everyone has to have the same amount and and parcel out every reward because that just gives too much power to a government. But it also doesn't mean that you have the opposite extreme where the name of the pool people died and it's their own fault cuz they're lazy and stupid. It's not true. It's not you mean and what we need to do is find the right balance between competition and freedom that makes everyone better off and recognition that just because there are going to be people who are not as smart, but they don't deserve to starve. There are people who just going to be unlucky cuz a lot of wealth isn't distributed by talent and and hard work but there's a lot of luck that goes into it as well. And so we may want to send down some of the shark address of competition there and you just have to be either or and the thing is if you make one position taboo, and it makes things either or but how bizarre is it that these kind of rash Call conversations about this very important subject is Taboo in intellectual circles. And in any of the past some of it because people do tend to form intellectual Tribes Ascend you have sports teams and you root for your team. And you're in winter sports fan. When you acquire information. If you listen to become better and better performed in some objective way, it's too kind of enhance The Fan Experience. You want to find out what's great about your team. And what's the lawful about the other team and that's a human habit that we bring to intellectual debates where I end and Academia academics are susceptible to it is anyway, anyone else unless they take steps to recognize it and avoided but, you know, if you're on the left you root for the left, even if you're on the right not so much of the universities put in. The think-tank's you root for the right team, and you can't.

Discount evidence that goes against your ideology you kind of filter out the things that are a little bit embarrassing and people been adopt certain opinions is almost loyalty Badges and this is true of a lot of controversies that people often think or do do scientific illiteracy fly climate change. Where is Club scientists, why do people deny the obvious facts of of manmade climate change don't get nothing formation that we need better Outreach. I think we do need better Outreach and I talked about this now. That's what you serve Ace of how well people understand climate science is not virtually no correlation between acknowledgement of human-made climate change and sophistication and climate science to get people who do believe in humid climate change was incontrovertible fact at this point, but they don't really understand. Even think it was caused by a hole in the ozone layer and we can fix it by cleaning up toxic waste dumps like crazy beliefs, but they still on you know, what I would consider the right right side what happens if I didn't some politicize debates the people don't don't so much care about the truth. They care about what belief will learn them esteem in their their peer group rise in Psychology, but it's really bad when it comes to arriving at the best understanding of the truth collectively and what we need both in the left-wing academic departments and the right-wing think tanks is kind of recognition. We're probably all wrong about a lot of things especially if we talk to each other and an act like kind of litigators like lawyers who Mount the best possible case for our side to prosecuted against the other side that just not a good way of arriving at the truth. You got to kind of check the tendencies in yourself to just want more and more. Evidence for your belief and then force yourself to be enforced other people to be as open-minded as possible that you see on the left and on the right at there certain subjects that you if you support that subject you are automatically thought of as a left Winger. Have you support the subject your are automatically thought it was a right if you were on the right, you probably think you have it in some way like there's if if someone says to me that they think that climate change is a probably an overblown thing and it's a cycle that the world's been going through forever I go you're right winger almost always all about that bass by years ago and it's actually West true now that is always amazing changes. So sometimes I can be these changes This Is Us All by surprise and gay marriages one of them. People on the left had misgivings about climate change in the 90s. It was still something that a lot of people in the left. We're kind of have that baby. Let's not go that far is civil unions now hold for the country is flipped. But in general to these changes can happen, but you're right that a lot of opinions are just wealthy badges to a coalition and they can sometimes changing is very strange way. So we seen in the last year or so with with a Donald Trump who is in many ways a pre radical right winger in things. Like what do you think? What what's your opinion of Russia now for decades if you're on the rights you mistrusted Russia, and if you on the left there, you know, they weren't so bad. They misunderstood now. It's like totally flipped opinions on whether you trust Russia just because of the influence of Donald Trump shifted to the people on the road. Are more sympathetic to Russia have been almost Unthinkable a couple of years ago. It was kind of a right-wing cause and then front manage to flip. So what it shows is something to eat where I'm going with this and this is something that I would I change my mind. I used to think they were these ideologies kind of like religious catechisms where these are the belief that a follow from one another but a lot of us just Rod tribalism just like, you know in in sports the the players return through the tip the rosters with free agency and they used to be a good guy when I was on the other team now, he's a bad guy. He was Jerry Seinfeld when saving you you rooting for clothing Stock Yards at the tribalism things very very confusing to me because you you could see it like it's such an obvious pattern and that when it when it plays out like, you know, With a global warming thing. I was having a conversation with a guy in my Jiu-Jitsu class. I'll never forget this and he was like, oh that's because it's a cycle, you know, it's a cycle of global warming and and then to the climate change has always been a cycle and you know, the people that say that it's not it's like a wolf How to reset a scientist like I don't know a lot about global warming. I don't know a lot about climate change, but I know what I've read and it seems to me to be a very complex issue and I'm talking this twenty-five-year-old guy who was in the military who's telling me it says I mean, do you have an education? It's like no Michael. Why did you just automatically like decide that this is a more talking about the very temperature of the planet Earth that's going to be a complex. And what is causing it. Is it a carbon monoxide thing. Is it a me? What why do you just automatically subscribe to that sentence because that's how his tribe communicates. Yeah. This is how his tribe and that it gives people Comfort to be in these weird little groups where everybody has groupthink. Yeah, and this is Enlightenment now because it is a book that argues for the importance of reason and how there has been progress. Thanks. New application of reason and a natural pushed back is well, you look at things like that. We don't seem so reasonable what's going on that we should be getting less reasonable and I think the answer is there a reason can work in four different goals and he's using the ideas of Yale Skull Island on which there's actually a kind of rationality that kind of belief namely when you vote. What are the chances that your votes will be going to swing the election pretty close to zero and when you express an opinion in your with your peer group, what are the chances that will lead you to be kind of condemned in ostracized and treated as a real. Weirdo. You're very high. So if you're if everyone thinks what opinion is going to help my esteem in the people I care about they can latch onto all kinds of Will we see if they've become kind of identity badges for their tribe? This is rational in terms of the world. They live in it's not so rationale for the planet as a whole if people just subscribed to believe spaced on tribal loyalty instead of Truth and that the challenge is how do we align beliefs more with truth and less with tribal loyalty that's not hopeless because there's a lot of beliefs that people used to have that are that have been bad then overturned people don't believe in unicorns anymore or out comedian fuel people believe in astrology and a lot of scientific issues are in no controversy do antibiotics work on the right or the left side part of the challenges. How do we get more and more of our beliefs to be to get have our social norms be such that if you believe something just cuz you're on the writers on the left they are an idiot, but what you should be doing is looking at the best possible study with an open mind. That's what a Cooper. That's a no me an idiot. Just parrots the both of them bright white wine. That's the kind of social change. We we need to aim for Ryan just a shame meaning of that kind of ignorance this distance desire the people have to subscribe to a predetermined pattern of thinking and behaving because it's it's comforting it's comforting that you know, and that also like they know that other people on their group will also think like that. If you're in the right one of the things about you see about right-wingers is kind of hilarious. I was watching this Kyle Kuklinski secular Talk podcast where he was talking about this these that Christians were talking about Trump and when you are on the right, you must have a belief in God you just have to and when they were talking about Trump they were saying we're talking about the man that existed before he accepted Jesus, you know, I don't have it but the guy was literally saying I don't have a past. Okay, how about you cuz I've accepted Jesus Christ into my life and that one. Accept Jesus Christ, like you are now a believer in Christ in your for your forgiven for all your past sins. This is this is us on the right. There's a giant percentage of the people that are on the right that's subscribe to a religious Christian mindset. It is fascinating Christian. Yeah. We are that we've ever had asked is accepted Jesus sure. I Temperance chivalry and this guy is lewd and vainglorious and arrogant contemptuous for losers. But what shows again it's going back to our discussion. It's just amazing. How much of a oil he doesn't have to do with the actual content of the beliefs. It's just whoever is on on my side. And of course he promised. A lot of perks for the four out of the religious right like the repeal of the Amendments that I have tax-exempt organizations can't engaging in politics in a lobbying if it's so hot the Johnson amendment in which meant that if your church if you don't pay taxes, you can't be politically active living like that and he promised to repeal an amendment and so he got their loyalty and so it's just raw political muscle kind of overcame Christian virtue. So bizarre to watch just these patterns. He's tribal audiological patterns. When you you see these groups that have the sort of one Mind Set On This the very clear as I can flip another example in a left green cause that's considered to be a cause of the right. Why well, if you want to if you're a left-wing activists in sick DC would say well, the only people concern of the environment are rich people who like the view from their Country Estates and they don't want to be spoiled by going to be in cut down for apartments for poor people or burial duck Hunters who want to be able to go and Hunt ducks. And and if you really socially concerned you should care about Vietnam and racism and poverty is just a luxury to worry about your trees and flowers and and ducks that I flipped and then environmentalism became a left-wing cause but it sees these connections between your Coalition and your beliefs aren't set in stone wasn't it in the beginning of the forming of this the political parties. That was the Democrats are very different and Republicans are more like Democrats. Oh, yeah. Well starting with Abraham Lincoln the first Republican president against slavery through the sixties in the south. The Democrats were the right-wing kind of racist party music George Wallace the governor of Alabama who said segregation now segregation forever use a Democratic party in 68 then back in 72. He ran for the Democratic nomination and the southern Democrats were the kind of the right-wingers. It was off in the Northeast Republicans who are the Liberals that still partly true in Massachusetts that we had a little bit of a remnant of that. We've had some liberal Republican Governors. We have one right now Charlie Baker you pretty moderate middle-of-the-road William weld who is Stanley libertarian vice presidential candidate? He was a republican governor. He was a particularly Conservative Republican. So there's the remnant of that in Massachusetts that used to be a little bit of that in New York where they were Liberal Republicans. But yeah, that's the case where it's now Democratic rules left-of-center Republican, right or Center. Yeah, you seen some of that also with some Republicans of try to disingenuously connect the Democratic party with the KKK because of the past well, and that was true. That was that was true about the people in the present. You know, this is the party that supported KKK. Well, yeah different people. Yeah, it's it's just fascinating to me to watch these groups of people and you know, we've talked about political parties of the right versus the left. It's always weird to me that there are these two sides and that people sort of take Comfort Inn in choosing this group that they I with these identity issues where are you know, I identify as a right-wing. I identify as a left identifies this that these these things are very rigid in their structure and they don't allow for nuance thinking and they don't allow for a bit being objective about issues and considering the other side considering other people's points of view and end in the way. They're looking at things and thinking of maybe there's some common ground. I agree with the case for reason science humanism in progress. And so have a chapter one reason why I asked the question. Why does it on the one hand if you're still getting smarter, there's the Flynn effect of rising IQ scores and a lot of areas in life. Will you see just much more Intelligence being applied in just a few years ago. So just for example you're moving in In space medicine what your doctor does it's just based on kind of superstition and tradition and now people are saying well let's let's do a randomized controlled trial see what works what doesn't so medicines getting smarter. Look at policing. One of the reasons that the crime rate has gone down so much another positive development that I talked about. The people aren't aware of is a policing has gotten smarter every day, especially in New York. They would gather data as to where the homicides were which neighborhoods which blocks and which neighborhoods and then concentrate that police forces on that day and took prevent things from getting out of control with me in a cycles of Revenge. Look at sports EU Moneyball. Were you got kind of smarter teams that can beat reach Richard teams you look at policy and you got your evidence based policy to always areas where it looks like their countries getting smarter, but then it all these are the kind of Jupiter and a lot of them are I argue cases where people wear issues get politicized and then people just go with their own Coalition and the ideal would be in this is an ideal that's in Christian Science and just having practice and there's not left Wings Lansing right wing science. It's one of the date of the word of the day to say where I haven't say Let's do an experiment. Let's see who's right who's wrong and either side might be embarrassed and I think in the case of these great political and economic issues, we got we be better off if we thought like scientists kept an open mind say well what works does a minimum wage lead to higher unemployment because labor becomes more expensive. Well, maybe if I do dis Tew much welfare make people we know an ambitious and Lacey. Well, I I can't figure this out for my armchair. Let's look at the different compare different countries compare different states and cities. Issue after issue, I think we need to be much more pragmatic and hope into evidence. But when you do deal with these issues much like you were talking about the difference between genders when you deal with the actual raw data that Rod data a lot of it gets very problematic for people that hold these ideas very and rigidly in their mind and they don't they don't want to accept certain facts and statistics and they come up with reasons why these things are either inaccurate or biased or racist or sexist or what-have-you. I wish you didn't make us into into the scientist so much. Is it to intuitive lawyers and preachers? Right? So we are natural tendency is to amass the strongest possible case for your own side. Yes, and to post that you that you have on the side of her show that people disagree with you or idiots and then mend and Evil. And we got to push back against that tendency to recognize that in my own mind when it comes up, but it's it's so incredibly, that tribalism that we see on the right in the lap. We see it men versus women. We oftentimes see it even in gay vs. Straight. It's it's it's a very bizarre but incredibly common aspect of being a human being it really is and I start out as a psychologist and a clinical psychologist testing how the mind works and so one of my ideas on which way we're going to keep going in a positive direction are influenced by a recognition of what makes us tick and what are the pitfalls in having a human brain that mean I don't take credit for this this goes back to trample the American Founders and framers Madison and Jefferson and Adams and Hamilton were arguing we set up a new country this new government. They what kind of intuitive psychologists and they have pointed out that well if you just Empower a leader he's going to get drunk with his own power and he's going to be diluted and what do we do about that? Cuz we do need some kind of leader. Well, we got these checks and balances. How to what makes people get off will they do if they can exchange things and each one produces something that good at And Trades it with something that someone else produces how do we set up a country where that takes advantage of people's tendency to trade things. So the connection between politics and psychology was has been there for a long time. Now the this subject Enlightenment that's a very loaded subject to State and specially in the world of weirdos and cult leaders and charlatans and people are sort of promoting the side idea of the this idea that you can achieve this is sort of Zen state of bliss of being above it all of being wise to the point of being a sage like that's a that's a weird concept isn't in today Sammy's editor. I went to a bunch of titles for it as I was writing. It said we're going to confuse it with you in the meeting that I had in mind was sweetie movement in the 18th century to apply reason to human betterment the ideas of human Adam Smith and the American Founders like Jefferson and Madison and John Locke and Thomas Hobbes and they've kind of 17 and 18 century and we got some people confused and I think this is a path to my books could be a passport spiritual enlightenment. Well, let him buy the book of the two meetings listed first and most of the dictionary is listed the sense that I had in mind first name of the movement to the 18th century toward greater reason is the spiritual distinction right spiritual enlightenment is the one that people's right now. You're perfectly honest. That's not what the book is about right. Well as some people think it is me to go by the book by accident. Do you meditate while you're such a smart guy? Like, why would you do that? Why would there be anything that you think you should do that? You don't do it. That's a really good question. Cuz I'm not that it's not that it's just a matter of like practice and you know, that's right. I think so, with that met you the couch that you got French Buddhist monk who sang Wai see eye-to-eye with and a lot of matter. She looks forward to the French translation of the better angels of our nature the whole room meditated practices that you do do to chart. Keep your your mind clean like to do exercise regularly are exercise exercise by so I don't I tend not to hang around in Jim's but I like jogging cycling hiking and kayaking. I like outdoor exercise and more aerobic than Ben Ben 10 bodybuilding. Yeah. They said that's one of the best things for cognitive function high-intensity aerobic exercise that yeah, and I tried to answer step back and some discipline on this. So social media suck email and with that with my wife and Rebecca Goldstein of novels and philosopher and we have a lot in common and it'd be kind of wasting life if I didn't get to enjoy enjoy time with her. San Marcos, she's also a workaholic so we both have conscious of no left left and go for a walk. Do you have a goal when you're writing a book like this or is it just you you have an interesting subject and just sort of follow-through come across some really deep exciting interesting idea that I think has not been made public enough. So in the case of the better angels of our nature it was the fact that in by all these measures violence has been in historical declined and this is like a mind-blowing fact and I came across it by various historians political scientists psychologists. I sent me their data and it's going to sitting on all these graphs showing the will getting less violent and don't know about it. So I wanted to I thought I had an important story to tell And I had a big intellectual challenge namely. Can I have a psychologist? I like to think I understand how the mind works but is a big puzzle. Why were our ancestors so violent and how come we're less violent. We're going to the same animals that we were a couple hundred years ago likewise with a new book with Enlightenment. Now, then I just got even more good news that if you look at other measures of human well-being like poverty Like A literacy, like the number of work hours, like disease graph after graph looks like we made improvements car safety plane safety workplace safety pedestrian safety death by fire Death by Drowning almost all of them are going down. And so that was a story that I thought I was excited by it because I knew that when people came across that they would find it interesting and it was again and intellectual challenge. How do you explain it? And I attributed to the Enlightenment ideas. Do you encounter much resistance to this narrative from Bowdon Bloom people owe you bet epidemic that's for sure on direction. There's their big threats always a possibility of nuclear war. We got to be really careful not to do anything stupid until I get back by the world walk the world back from nuclear weapons in the future and climate change. Some people just don't believe it terrorism. They're kind of jerking us around the terrorists by doing NC weensy bit of violence that guess a huge amount of publicity. So let's not let ourselves get jerked around by terrorists and and Rampage Shooters not giving so much publicity concentrate on where the deaths really are like you in car accidents like an ordinary homicides like an opioid deaths. Let's go look at the numbers and not Will buy paper headlines of a massive reaction to any Mass tragedy like a mass shooting or something along those lines, but that this is a natural thing right because this is seems so strange that it could occur. 
========,9,title.
It's a natural thing to have this reaction to this horrible tragedy, but we don't have a reaction to you know, how many thousands of people die every day because of obesity or even if we concentrate on violence we forget about the guy who shoots his wife pussy. She thinks she's been flirting too much or the two guys who have a fight in a bar over who gets to use the pool table next to one of them is light. What is the line get on the floor? And these are there far board borders of that kind than our terrorist killings every day. There are something like twenty-five of those those homicides and so it's like a Sandy Massacre day after day after day after day and they don't make the headlines cuz they occur, you know bit by bit here and there but it's still incredibly confusing to people when someone does do something like the Vegas shooting like what what is this like so I have a discussion of that just cuz you do such a puzzle and because it attracts so much attention and it a lot of it is just a notoriety. These are often you're not always but they're often kind of nobodies and their life is gone going to go down the toilet and they're thinking well, how can I do something that makes my life meeting phone call in a blaze of glory and so they think we are what is the what is the one thing you can do that's guaranteed to make you famous by tomorrow. The answer is kill a bunch of innocent people and you're registered perverse fact about the world and so few people wear Fame and meaning and mattering are more important than anything including life itself. We've kind of given this in this perverse opportunity to become a Somebody by because we just give them Waka waka news coverage in a mass shootings and they sort of tragedies along with social media and more media in general probably a some and they do tend to be occurring in Cycles. There's a copycat phenomenon until people get a little bit bored and then there is that and so there is a suggested policy actually signed on to this from some criminologists that the news media should not publish the names or the faces of mass killers that are what's new maybe newsworthy that happened but the particular name of the guy wife, why is that a problem is it gets clicks yagis quickie right to mean it's just there's so many articles that you see today that you you look at the title of the article on it has very little to do with the actual article itself it just because they come up Bees salacious headlines are just so they're so attractive and it seems like today especially you're seeing less and less people reading the Washington Post the New York Times for the LA Times that they're struggling and one of the ways they keep up is by giving people what they want if it bleeds it leads if it goes right out, who is this crazy-ass hold the shot 58 people what let's find out what's going on in his life. So is his dad who is this? Who's his brother? Exactly and you wouldn't believe what happened to the 1970s actress so and so and find a picture of her in her seventies and she had that kind of clickbait but this is us real harm bright and there are other and you have to balance it against God's freedom of the press. You don't want there to be your government's to tell newspapers were they can publish but there have been some precedents where the Press has voluntarily and post some standards that do. Nothing to Applegate freedom of the press doesn't make people better also give an example from Sports when the TV networks adopted a policy of not filming fans that run onto the field. Turning onto the field cuz why did I do it so they can say, you know, hi Mom to be broadcasted 300 million TV. Of course, I've no longer publishing me names of juvenile killers, and I know that was a voluntary restraint and it was socially responsible and I think there is something to be said for for not giving Rampage Killers for the audience that they seek. Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense in terms of you know, the greater good of humanity. But if you're a newspaper guy and you see you're at your business is just a cell new spare. So you're a you're a bottom line person that the whole thing is just to include increase the amount of Revenue that comes into your Institution. I'm not go bankrupt. Yeah today right today and so on and they still have a huge readership and a day do they have to look at themselves in the mirror. They do have journalistic codes of Ethics. That's kind of one of the things that distinguishes them from the fake news in there with the rumor Mills. And so and that will always attract a large following you you want to be able to trust what you can read. And so they've got of I think balance that against raw bottom line cuz they lose their integrity than that's also good for the bottom line on a long ride either. 
========,9,title.
Do you think that there's a new media today in terms of I mean, we obviously have these established places like the New York Times and like the Washington Post, but I wonder if that These these like well-respected long-standing traditional venue that I wonder if that's really the right way to do it anymore. Well, there has been a genius with fabric on the bottom feeders in their throat. But the QuickPay factories, there are a lot of really good new electronic magazines. Yes, novox and medium Pacific Standard Nautilus lat and that he on and you know that either so and in the future a couple decades earlier slate three things that you're not going to find necessarily in the infield for legacy papers and they responsible in that fact Checkers and they're going to they're not they're not clickbait factories. I'm so there is almost any Quality Inn in intelligent media where there's a lot of real crap at the bottom, but there's also room at the top for for new voices when you look at a guy like the president of the United States Hulu Herbs to use that term fake news. So it's it's one of those the weirder times ever is his attacks on the media because it seems to be very similar to like the way he reacted to Barack Obama mocking him during that speech like the media when they criticize him a critique him. His response is to completely attacked them and just say that they're useless and fake and it's weird time for 4 news when it comes to to that and for journalism, you know, I agree it is a very disturbing phenomenon because there is a phenomenon a fake news but fake news is not the same thing as coverage that criticizes the President right exactly example of a real lack of comprehension of democracy Works. Mainly if you're the president you can be will be should be criticized. Yes, how democracy works we don't have a supreme device. Weider that we consider infallible and then you see any chance that we bow down in front of it everything. He says goes he's temporarily kind of a steward you temporarily overseeing the government back in a few screws up and he says something's not true. The people have the right to criticize criticize him and they better be that criticism. Otherwise, we're going to get into it and taking any criticism in and labeling it fake news, which is a real problem fake news is a genuinely anti-democratic impulse and it's a really disturbing it is disturbing. It's also disturbing his attacks on the different intelligence agencies tax on that long Force. Yeah. It's just it's real weird. So it's real weird that you know it if you boil it all down and you look at it like a what's going on or what anyone anyone that's after him anyone is attacking him criticizing him like that these people get demeaned and he uses his info. Watching his power kind of shot down all these criticisms without any seemingly without any concern for the long-term consequences of diminishing the impact of these media. What makes progress possible is that we have the institutions that are smart and any of the flawed individuals that make it make it up fat in a week. No one of us in particular is that good and decent and wise we can set up rules and institutions that make the society is a whole better than any of the individuals that make it up and democratic government is the prime example and the hold the difference between a democracy and a cult of personality like now in China or Stalin and rush hour Hitler in Germany, or Agave in that Zimbabwe now or the Kim's in North Korea is that we don't worship supreme leader who embodies the virtue of the people that's the idea that the United States tried to get away from the ideas. You got a procedure. You got some rules of someone making decisions, but you kind of raining in and it's not about him. It's about the whole system and the fact that you've now got a leader understand that he seems to think that's all about him and that if you just I alone can solve that trust me. Let me do it and the all these rules and regulations are the Deep State the administrative State. Thank God for the Deep State administrative state it prevents some despot from wasting his crack brain schemes on the whole population. We we do need rules and bureaucrats and checks and balances as Sick and criticize the leader as a psychologist when you're looking at all. This is is this a fascinating study to you or is it terrifying right? You really don't want human psychology to be to terminate vote the fate of the world, right? You kind of want or at least you want one product of human psychology collectively and rationally agree upon to be embodied a set of rules and procedures. Yes. And so it's not about that guy. There's also a way of Behaving that we deem presidential and Barack Obama in my opinion and body. Better than anybody he was he's very composed like one of the most composed leaders ever and in terms of like the leader of the United States like the way he would communicate and the way he would respond to criticism. He just had a very sort of composed higher level of his ability to communicate Is it was just it was very clean in a way, you know, there's a reason for it isn't just that it makes you feel good when you see it, but it actually is making a statement namely it isn't about me cry. I'm occupying this office not to approve. What a big shot. I am with a genius. What a glorious Noble Divine figure I am but I've got this big responsible. I've got the power to kill millions of people or how to make them better off or worse off. I take that seriously. It's not about me feeling really empowered is about me kind of serving the people that elected me and that kind of self-restraint and respect for the office is a way of reaffirming that principle of democracy. Is that the person who's Charge is this is how a lot of the rest of the country views the nation itself. I can if you have a person who is measured and objective mean well thought-out and well-spoken and that when when you would hear especially Obama speeches agree with them or disagree with them, everything was a very clean like the way he and then maybe I use the word clean too much but it was it was eloquent was smarter than most people, you know, it was a bore more articulate than most people. Do you know though this the way the sentences were formed. Where are impressive in the the intellectual capacity of the the person that's delivering those words. And so that made us feel better about who we were as a country. Where being led by this very wise smart person. What do you agree with his policies are not there's no denying that this is a isn't except. No human, I think there's a greater reason behind it to United States has the most powerful military matters to the rest of the world and to reassure the rest of the world that we're not just a bunch of cowboys were going to do what's makes us the most powerful but we really think about our role. We we don't we don't do rash things that could really be bad for the world that gets conveyed symbolically in the way that a leader comports himself for one day herself of the when I see this whole thing going down and I see also this reaction to this President like the giant women's March being called the women's March all day and it is a woman's March but it's also March against the president. That's a big part of what this says. It's like the idea that he is kind of against women in their eyes are there that's correct or not. But that this March is too short. It's sort of show solidarity that they Free with the way things are going and I wonder if having a guy like this in power is going to as we're talking about before the sort of Swing effect.

Re reignite more people to be politically active and more people to do recognize the things they don't like like the calling the media fake news or like the attacks on the intelligence Community all these these various things these things that people deem to be racist these things that people deemed to be you no hostile. It was silly that he says and that they'll be some sort of a powerful reaction in response to that as bad as a hope. Yeah. It's too soon to tell because there's two possibilities and one of them is that he's so shattered some Norms created a precedent that needs their successors could be even even worse. Try it because Norms can be fragile like what you just don't do if your prayer Well now you can do them, right that's the pessimistic View and the optimistic view is cuz you'll say oh my god. Look what we've been through. We try that. Lets get we we we we we we tried crazy. Let's get back to saying right. I suppose that those are the two possibilities you're out of time. Yes. Listen to thank you so much for being here your book one more time and lighting it now like science humanism and progress. Thank you so much has been an honor and a pleasure. Really appreciate you being. Thank you so much Joe. Thank you.
