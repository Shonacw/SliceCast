4 3 2 1 boom, and we're like 12 rules for life. So without reading this so what you're saying is that's what I like. Doing right? That's it. Yeah. Yeah this interview that you just did with this woman Cathy Newman. It was on the UK. It was Channel 4 UK. I just went I felt bad. But I was also laughing. I went to her Twitter page to read like an in with each one of her tweets. No matter what she says someone right underneath it. So what you're saying is and then some dick but by the way, the your fans were mocking her but politely not aggressively their yd. I didn't read any rude things like it was no it was no insults or it what may be a few insults with no swears. It was just playful mocking of the interview that she did with you because the interview was ridiculous was a ridiculous interview. When I ride Listen to It's ever watched it several times like this is so strange like her determination to turn into a conflict between the issues that I have with tea. Because they have a very limited amount of time and they're trying to make things of salacious is possible. They want to have your sound bites this clickbait sound bites and she just went into it incredibly confrontational not trying to find your actual perspective. But trying to force you to defend a non non realistic perspective. Guess what I was that I was the hypothetical feeling of Her Imagination essentially what what happened what was interesting to the way it played itself out because I met her in the Green Room beforehand, you know, she was being made up and then they put a little bit of powder on me and we had a friendly kind of interchange then we went and sat in front of the cameras in for a couple of minutes, you know before before the show got rolling and we got a pretty Pleasant back and forth and then as soon as the cameras went on she was a completely different person and I thought oh, I see. I see what's going on. Yeah. Well, so so that kind of alerted me to while the fact that there was something rotten in the state of Denmark. Let's say Also why YouTube is going to kill TV because television by its nature all of these neural broadcast. Technologies, they they rely on forcing the story right because it has to happen. Now it has to happen in like often in 5 minutes cuz the only broadcast 5 minutes of that interview they did put the whole thing up on YouTube to their credit. You haven't ceased to amaze me yet. I think that they thought that the interview went fine. That's the scuttlebutt. I got from sort of behind-the-scenes because I you know, I know some people who know what's going on at channel 4 and their shell shocked by the response, you know, and abandoned. Of course, there is the counter response the guardian the next day published a paper published an article saying that you know the head of Channel 4 had to call in police security because of threats, you know, well, first of all, you can call the police in about anything and they never did detail out exactly what the threats were, you know, but then about 20 newspapers pick that up and went for the well Cathy Newman is now I'm being harassed by an army of online trolls for doing nothing, but doing her job which Twilight and then there was a backlash against that in the Press so it's being a well I took an audit of the the actual end interchange is it between fans and her and there was way more negative ones coming your way? Yes that we're seriously negative. Yeah, that's right violent harassing just rude the way more and no one picked up on that all it was all the narrative was. She's a victim even though she was highly aggressive on in this but she's not successful. You know, it's not what you think. You should have to hand in your victim card. I think like when you go to an ivy league university is like right then and there at the same time. That's just too much was one of the things that you point it out was when you were talking about competition for very lucrative jobs. And you were saying look what you've done by don't you you must have had to work here and she proud. He was saying how hard she had to work to get there. Like we'll yes, of course, no one's going to hand this to you know, this is why on and this is why you were saying you are opposed to equality of outcome, I can't imagine anything we could possibly strive for in our society that would make it into hell faster than equality of outcome like the historical the historical evidence for the pathology of that route is so strong. It's like You have to be historically ignorant beyond belief or malevolent or resentful beyond comprehension in order to think that that's a good idea I argue for that I agree with you, but I think that even if you came into this with no knowledge of history but a complete understanding of human beings you would say. Well that doesn't make any sense and one of the best quotes that I've ever read about it is that if you have real true Freedom, you're never going to have a quality about because the wood real true Freedom. You have the freedom to not and if you need if you look at a guy like Jeff Bezos for instance that Amazon guy is worth more money than anybody ever write that guy works all day. I mean, he's a maniac acquiring all these different companies in and everything he's doing is designed to succeed. I mean, he's just what I just said to send it in a recent interview and I know some guys that are you know there in approximately the same universe as those two and they just work all the time. That's all they do and they don't just work they work. So if Play and so effectively and make use of every second in ways. You can't even imagine unless you're in that sort of position. So and Anna doing that doesn't mean that you will succeed but not doing it certainly means that you will fail you. Will you will not doing it certainly means you'll never achieve that level of success and that's what we're talking about were talking about equality of outcome. I don't want that. I don't want to be that guy. I don't want to work like that. I don't want to do what he's doing and I should have the freedom to not do that as he should have the freedom to do that. If we're going to play this game called capitalism, which we're all green is probably at least as far as the model that we have right now is the best one that we have if we're all going to play this game if someone decides to be the Michael Jordan of capitalism, you can't stop them. You can't say no. No, no. No, you're playing this game too. Well, you're playing too hard you're too obsessed with this game. You're going to have that you can stop them. You can try to stop people from winning crookedly. Yes, just what you should do. And yes. Clerks 2 that too because there's a sort of marxist notion that all this inequality is generated as a consequence of capitalism and now it's actually technically false cuz if you look at there's a there seems to be something like a law of nature that described by this statistical model called the predo distribution and it basically suggests that in any creative domain there's going to be a small number of people will do almost all of the output but it doesn't just apply to human beings it imply. It applies to the heights of trees in the Amazon rainforest. It applies to the size of cities and it applies to the massive starts, which is it something like the more you have the more you get it's something we could ask how that would work with a star as it gets bigger and bigger and its gravitational mass increases. It's going to attract more and more matter and then I was a city grows one more and more people are excited to move there because of all the opportunities and so some cities start to grow tremendously and others and others don't but this this This phenomenon where a small number of people end up controlling a tremendous proportion of the resource is not only limited to money and it doesn't only occur in capitalist societies. It occurs everywhere is like a natural law. So you see the same thing with number of points scored by a you-know-what spectacular sports figure. There's always a tiny proportion of people who are way they wait ahead way ahead on the curb for people who make records or people who sell paintings or people who composed music for people who sell music online. It's all the same. It's it's the one percent gets 80% and so well first we can't blame it on capitalism and second. We should note that it actually does constitute a problem which is what the left-wingers are always jumping up and down about right like too much inequality starts to destabilize your society and it isn't obvious how to shovel money from the top and maybe the one tenth of 1% who have almost all the money down to the people who have almost nothing in a way that's effective so that they don't get thrown out of the game completely. So that the whole society doesn't destabilize we don't exactly know how to do that. It is a problem because it equality does exist and it does tend to magnify across time and then there's another problem to which we haven't figured out his imagine that in order to make everyone Rich. Do you have to tolerate a certain amount of inequality and seems obvious? We don't know how many units of inequalities you need to tolerate per unit of wealth generated, but the answer is definitely not zero. It's definitely not zero. So yeah, so it goes back to this equality of outcome India and this thing has perplexed me since I've met you and since you were involved in this original debate over gender pronouns, and there was an article that was written recently. I forget the exact title evidence I think was something along the lines of why can't people here with Jordan Peterson saying you are misrepresented more than anyone I know in a weird way you are Colonized in a weird way where I can't believe these people are honestly looking at your opinions and coming up with these conclusions. I I I can't help but feel like what is happening is people are consciously deciding to ignore reality and paint you as this archetypal figure of oppressive white male patriarchy ignorance fill in the blank with all the rest of the descriptive that you'd like to use but they've decided to paint you in this way like as As a Target because they need a Target to sort of reinforce this idea that transgender people are being victimized and women are being victimized and deeper that the right narrative is the way that we should view the world is victim vs. Oppressor because that's the basic postmodern neo-marxist template. It's the right way to view the world is that it's a it's a power ground what it's a it's a battleground of power interests competing constantly the ones that win our oppressors the ones that loser oppressed. That's the way you look at the world and I think that that's wrong that's a bad way of looking at the world psychologically sociologically politically economically, idiot. Logically you name it it it ends in nothing but catastrophe I mean first of all because it puts your group identity as something is Paramount and I mean, that's just not well that freaks that isn't what we do in the west. Let's say we put your individual identity Paramount. And then well, that's just that's just for starters fundamentally and then I guess the other reason that people are on my case to some degree is because I have made a strong case which I think is fully documented by the scientific literature that there are intrinsic differences say between men and women and I think the evidence or not. This is the thing that staggered me is that no serious scientists have debated that for like four decades. It's that argument was done by the time I went to graduate school everyone knew that human beings were not a blank slate that biological forces parameterize the way that we thought in and felt and acted in and and valued everyone knew that the fact that this has become somehow debatable again is just especially because it's being done by legislative Fiat. They're forcing it to me as an example. What is turtle man was originally just a piece of legislation that mandated that female sports teams were funded to the same degree that male sports teams were funded in American universities, but it's being expanded out so that if there's any differences in any areas whatsoever between the genders then the universities are being taken to court and like 200 of me last. I looked about 200 of them and they can have their funding revoked if they violate title and Provisions, so it's become like a vicious weapon for social justice Warrior equality of outcome types. And so it's not just about sports know. It's got Way Way Beyond that. Yeah. It's it's it's become an equality of outcome issue fundamentally. It was an article that I sent you one of them was from I think I got I got I got it off of digg.com but it was Jordan Peterson is having his moment and we should ignore him and I sent it to you and there was one of the last part of that might be true. 
========,9,title.
One of the things in the article was citing the study that showed very little difference in Oso are men and women more similar or more different. Well, it depends on how you define the terms first, but they're more similar. Well, why while they're the same species so we can start with that like but the question is what are the differences and how do they manifest themselves and are those manifestations important? So here's an example. If you took a random woman out of the population and a random man, and he had to bet on who was more temperamentally aggressive. If you bet on the man you'd be right 60% of the time but you'd be wrong 40% of the time in that that's not a walloping difference. Right? 60/40. It's not 90/10 like so there's quite there's a lot of overlap between men and women in terms of their levels of aggression. You think while they're more of the same? Yeah, except so then let's say no to let's play a slightly different game. Let's pick the one in a hundred most aggressive person from the random population with her old man. And that's why all the people in prison are men. So even though on average to 95% right? So and often if the women are in prison is cuz they got tangled up with a really bad guy. You know, so so one of the problems is that Difference is at the extreme are where the difference is really start to manifest themselves until you can have a small difference at the level of the average butt out at the extremes. It starts to make a massive difference. So let's say to be a Google engineer, which is hard right because he's not only have to be an engineer but you have fever good engineer say, well you have to be interested in things rather than people that's a that's a huge difference in interest like men or more interested in things generally speaking and women are more interested in people generally speaking now is still a lot of overlap between them. But that's one of the biggest differences between men and women's been demonstrated cross-culturally. It's also very big difference in the Scandinavian countries. On average the difference isn't that great even though it's a relatively large difference, but at the extremes it's the same thing almost all the people that are hyper. What would you call hyper focused on saying they're almost all men and all the people who are hyper focused on people or almost all women. And so how does that play out in the world? Well in the Scandinavian countries, it plays out this way, but 85% of nurses in Scandinavia are female and about eighty-five to ninety percent of Engineers are male. It doesn't mean women can't be Engineers. It doesn't mean men can't be nurses. It also doesn't have anything to do with intelligence, but it does have to do with interest and the difference is an interest are big now at the Extremes in particular. So when you read a review like that the one that was pointed out. The first question is well, what do you mean by big and little there's more overlap? There's more overlap between men and women there is difference on virtually every parameter. Okay, fine are the remaining difference is significant and how they play out in the world that answer. Overwhelmingly significant because you select for extremes. So here's another example Ashkenazi Jews have an average IQ of 115. So in the typical population of raw has an average IQ of a hundred fifteen points is about the difference between the typical college student and a typical high school student. Okay, so it's not a massive difference. But if you go to the extreme say, well, let's go look at people who only have an IQ of 145 which is kind of where you hit the beginnings of genius-level. It's like the Jews are overwhelmingly over-represented. Show relatively small differences in the average can produce Wallop and differences at the extremes of people don't understand that's not surprising cuz it it actually requires a fairly sophisticated grasp of Statistics. But when were talking about things like differential outcome in the workplace, then you have to take a sophisticated statistical approach to it or you don't know what the hell you're talking about and unfortunately many of the people who were talking about things like gender differences have no idea what they're talking about. They don't know the literature if they don't know there is a literature they don't understand biology like that the social constructionist types the women's studies types the neo-marxist. They don't give a damn about biology. It's like they inhabit some disembodied universe. So the review was poorly written at best and did not show did very poor grasp of the relationship between group differences and economic and practical outcomes. It's not just that it's deceptive and there's there's an e in some way on that side this side of the debate the anti Jordan Peterson side to label men and women as being virtually identical when there's so much evidence that that's not the case and what you're saying what you've never said one is superior one is inferior. What you are is a guy who is pointing out the reality of the difference between the various types of human beings and you've been very open about the extremes about you, but I'm I'm well aware the extremes I deal with MMA fighters. I know a lot of female MMA fighters are as aggressive and as tough as any man you're ever going to meet in your life and I know a lot of men from Comedy that are Meek little guys who they're not nearly as aggressive as some of these female Fighters like there's I think one of the beautiful things about freedom is that people get an opportunity to express themselves in a way that genuinely them and whether that is like our friend Alex Honnold who's a free climber who is like climbing up these fantastic mountains. No ropes or whether it's a female MMA fighter like Raquel Pennington is just a tank and beat the shit out of people and that's what she loves to do. All of these extremes are available to people because of Freedom. This is not as suppressive thing. The ones that don't stopping people from choosing these pants. I don't know if you saw the most recent slip up by the CEO of YouTube. I retweeted it today. They were talking about why there's not as many women in Tech and she basically said they both her and they CEO of Google said exactly with James D'Amore was saying in his memo they completely fucked up. 
========,9,title.
They tried to look at this. This is goddamn James D'Amore this on his page. They respond women lack of Texas could you know go to Joe to go to James D'Amore is tweet just go to the what I retweeted and what he said, so there was a study published a while ago off jet, you know, Jamie scroll back up right there right there. Just just make it sweet larger. They go see if I don't know how to say her name is Susan what I'm sorry. I don't have the surname o w o j i c i c k. I said that women find geek email Industries as opposed to social Industries not very interesting and send our sights research on gender differences. That's exactly is a lawyer for James D'Amore be like, oh well, look who we have here. This is Checkmate. You dummies you just said what you said. He's really interesting, you know, because I think it's such a classic story of Of an engineer getting tangled up in politics. So I went to this diversity seminar and he wasn't very happy about it because he knew literature and so at the end of the seminar they ask for feedback James D'Amore is an engineer. So when you tell an engineer that you want feedback the engineer thinks all you want feedback and you and you want like facts and stuff, right? Cuz that's what feedback would you like to do more went and wrote this like Thoreau mammal and gave it to him. He said well, you know, this is what I think you're some feedback and then traveled around the he got no real response from the diversity people and then he posted it on one of these internal boards at Google where people can discuss things which people at Google do all the times. It was perfectly reasonable for him to post it because he didn't get a response from the Denver is too peopley thought. Well, let's see what other people think I did it was there for a long time until it was leaked into the outside world. It wasn't like the more was trying to expose Google for for what it is. He was just doing what an engineer type would do. When someone asked him to provide feedback because he's not thinking politically he's not thinking oh, they just want to hear what they already said. He thought they actually wanted some facts. Anyways, I think they picked on the wrong guy turns out to be pretty damn tough boy is very smart and a very kind God when you sit down and talk to him. He's not a sexist. He said he's a guy that's talking about facts. In fact, he wrote is more than a page-and-a-half. I believe on the strategies for getting more women interested in attacks. Not a sexist. This is just a guy that was talking about the differences in the choices that people make that's based on just that the variations that you were just discussing other there's a good study done a while ago and unfortunate remember the author but they were looking at Junior High math prodigies and they're they're pretty equally distributed between boys and girls but by the time University came along the math prodigy boys, they tend to go into the stem Fields, but the girls wouldn't and it doesn't because they lack the ability cuz they had Stellar ability. It's because they Interested and it turns out like the interesting turns out to be a big one. So with personality alone if you measure men and women personalities, and then you add up all the differences in personalities, you can tell with about 75 to 80% certainty by looking at a full personality redoubt weather persons male or female she'd be wrong 25% of the time something like that. But if you had interested that you can get up to about 90% And so, you know what you say. Well are these differences large? Well individually, they're not that big they make me more difference at the extremes, but if you add them up, Then you can almost completely differentiate men from women. So by that token there they're very large any interesting actually turns out to matter a lot. Like it's probably the most important individual difference that is being discovered between men and women at the psychological level and that's real decent explanatory power because you might say well men have a slight Edge in spatial intelligence and that's why they were represented in stem fields and women have a slight Edge verbal intelligence. This is debatable but literature kind indicates that and that's why they're overwhelmingly. The majority of fiction readers for example is that the reason that there is differential representation in the stem field is like no it doesn't seem to be it doesn't look like it's an intellectual issue, which is also what the more pointed out by the way. He never said once that it just was a cognitive issue, but it's a matter of choice matter of interest and women tend to be more more people oriented know you're saying is this is also being discovered in chimpanzees and other primates like if you offer baby or or Wild chimpanzees juvenile chimpanzees, the choice between being like toys like cars or people like toys like dolls. The males will go for the thing like toys in this email to go for the people like toys to see that in private and he's like, well, it's not surprising. It's like well, no, it's not it's not that surprising really mean women have to take care of infants tiny infants and you have to be really people-oriented to do that because a tiny infant isn't unbelievably demanding social relationship and it's a primary relationship for about two years. No one so women are tilted towards the kind of temperament that makes that possible so I can always had such a shock really that's just such a surprise. So it's not a surprise in the wood what's confusing to me is the narrative that anybody that points out these differences is somehow a sexist or discriminatory or They can borrow. I think the other reason that the way the left the radical lefties have been going after me to constantly is while there's one reason is is if you stand up against the radical radical left you're in a group that also has Nazis in it because the Nazis also stand up against the radical left. So it's perfectly reasonable from a strategic perspective for the radical leftist to say. Well you're against us. How do we know where you're not a Nazi? It's like while statistically statistically I'm probably not you know, so there's that but but you could say at least the question is open, but but but then the next part of it comes is that it's motivated apposite slinging because if I'm reasonable and I'm standing up against the radical left and they admit that I'm reasonable then there has to be a mission that reasonable people could stand up against the radical left which kind of implies that the radical left isn't that reasonable. 
========,9,title.
And so while they're not going to go there course, they're not that reasonable. Unreasonable beyond belief as we saw in this situation with Lindsay Shepherd in Canada. So at Wilfrid Laurier University talk about that real quick because that was fascinating to and that also had to do with you. So she was discussing you in class and if you could fill up Phil and everybody with a Communications in the Communications Department at Wilfrid Laurier and they were talking about the role of language in communication, which kind of what you would do any communication class and she decided to show a 5-minute clip from a program. I had done for TV Ontario, which is a public television station mainstream left-leaning liberal television station news program on there with a number of other people including up Professor Nicholas map from the University of Toronto who claimed essentially that there were no biological differences between men and women in that had beaten the scientific consensus for the last four decades. So anyways, she showed a clip from this well, she got hold in front of two professors and administrator, Adria Joel was basically hired for that purpose and raked over the coals for daring to show this video and she had the wherewithal to tape it and then she made the tape public. And in that tape they compared to beef. It was really black Lee Carmichael, you know, they compared me to Hitler Milo yiannopoulos. I thought you guys just a damn clueless. He can't even get your insults. Right? It's like you can't say that's like playing a video of Hadler or Milo yiannopoulos. It's like first of all Hitler and Milo yiannopoulos. They're actually not in the same category right except that they're both human that's about the narrowness of the category and and then Cormac provocateur and you can hate him or love it more or be different but put them in the same category as Hitler just shows how a muddle-headed you are and then to assimilate me to that category so carelessly you don't mess about with FF. It's like that, you know Hitler was one of the great super villains of the 20th century right when he was he's up there with Stalin and Mao in that. In the panoply of satanically possessed leaders, you don't just toss that around especially not when you're torturing your teaching assistant for daring to show a video about language in a communication class. And so that was a massive scandal in Canada with a biggest. So I think it was the biggest Scandal that ever hit a university in Canada and it's a lot of international attention and rightly. So and she also turns out to be a tough cookie. I mean the last I heard she was she'd started the club at Wilfrid Laurier and I think it was last night or the night before maybe it's coming up there going to show the video from television Ontario at a club meeting and invite people to come and discuss it. It's like they picked on the wrong girl there too. So they certainly did she's obviously very smart. You can hear that her discussion with them and how flabbergasted she was by their take on things. But this was essentially proof to a lot of people that were on the outside of how Preposterous some of the dialogue was Inside these universities and probably could've done me a bigger than having that Scandal because when I made a videos about Bill C 16 15 months ago, I said, look, here's what's going to happen because this legislation is written in an appalling Manner and the surrounding policies are pathological to here's what's going to happen until I laid it out and then people came out and said know you're being paranoid just like that's possible to build a legislation is going to have that effect know you're not a legal expert what the hell do you know, etc? Etc. You're crazy. You're a big fat gyro transform, you know, they made it through everything but the kitchen sink at me look for an outfit is it always a possibility that I was wrong? But the problem was as I read the policies and I understood them and I knew where they were leading, but I never imagined that one of the consequences of Bill C 16 and its sister legislation. Was that a teaching assistant that a Canadian University would be pilloried and accused of breaking the law and then accused of all sorts of reprehensible political beliefs by two professors and Ministrator hired for that purpose. I'm merely because she showed a video about two people talking about the law is like that that paranoid as I am. Let's say that that exceeded the grass for the reach of my imagination and then of course, it was made public and people just couldn't believe it and then you think okay. Well, what's the defense? Well, they misinterpreted Bill c16. No, I don't think so. They aren't representative of the University Professor Administration. Well all of him lot and his colleagues Rose to their defense the whole department the university when they apologize did it in a very mealy-mouthed way. Like there's no evidence that it was an anomalous occurrence So what had happened is Babe, over extended the reach of Bill C 16 in exactly the way that I said would happen. It was inevitable and it wasn't an anomaly. It was actually that's actually the way that the universities are in a just the way that they are it wasn't a one-off. It was exactly Diagnostic and it's appalling it's appalling the universities have so much to be ashamed of there their they're while there was an article in the Boston Globe this week saying the same thing that all of this crazy postmodern identity politics equality of outcome. Nonsense is not only disrupt at the University in a way that might be irreparable as far as I can tell but it's rapidly spreading outside into the Normal say business World, which was exactly what you see for example that Google will the tech industry in particular seems to be like more left-leaning than pretty much any industry there is and I guess it's because there's so many intelligent people there are so many people that has been a tremendous amount of time and universities and they get indoctrinated into this mindset and you're you're seeing that in this is the CEO of YouTube's response to the James D'Amore memo completely misrepresented the other talking about harmful gender stereotypes. That's not what he talked about it all what's fascinating to me about all of this is it it just reeks of tribalism that these people on the left have decided. I mean and I'm mostly on the left which is really crazy and me when it comes to most policies are most thoughts of the Quality Inn and the idea of just letting people be who they are. I mean, that's what the left used to stand for used to stand for being. Open minded Isa stand for being a reasonable person and didn't now it seems to be all about this very toxic tribal ideology. And this is one of the reasons why so many of these attacks and you are so baffling to me is because there's a willful ignorance or a deceptive narrative. There is a deceptive description of who you are and what you're saying what you represent and it's this conveniently categorize not even convenient willfully. It willfully deceptively categorized into these categories categories of homophobia transphobia sexism. These are reprehensible categories that if they can just shove something that you're saying figure out a way to push you into this little narrow can find then everyone has to disagree with you. Everyone has to insult you in everyone has to like take that girl into their office and chastise you for even you Not even speaking up for you, right Jesse gentian. She wasn't yes. That's what was more fascinating about it than anything. That's like presenting something Hitler said Dutra leak or maybe Milo yiannopoulos. It's it's so strange, but what they don't understand and this is what's really crazy is that the world is watching and that most people. But maybe it's a 60/40 look we're talking about before when it comes to the aggressive women versus aggressive men. I don't know what the number is but I think it's almost like I've been watching the comments on YouTube and so forth trying to track this is like, I think that like, I think that what the radical leftists are doing is overwhelmingly on representative of the general population, but there are there a very well organized and and verbal And prepared minority and they've occupied powerful positions in many many institutions HR one of the things I really can't figure out right now and for anybody who's running a company that's listening me should think this through like to let these postmodern neo-marxist into your company through the guise of Human Resources is an absolute catastrophe you going to pay for that this the ideologies that drives postmodern neo-marxism this identity politics what the identity politics movement and its insistence on equality of outcome is a powerfully anti-capitalist. It's powerfully Auntie Western why you would let that into your company is so that you can look good socially, let's say is beyond me. It's a big mistake. I agree with you, but I don't think people are aware of it. I think part of the problem is this Battle Ground is largely ignored by the general population. I don't think most people are aware of what's going on you are cuz you're obviously you're deeply embedded in the University system and I'm done near you're obviously now branching out into YouTube and podcast and all these different ways to get this information out. But the average person that is a CEO of a company or they're they're concerned with their own company. They're concerned with their own individual needs their concern with organizing things to keeping their bottom line and maybe she was concerned with looking Farren Yankee sure that they're not prejudiced and all of that which is laudable and but I just don't think they see the wave, now they don't they don't see it coming. They don't understand it and they're in cautious about it, but they're going to pay for it. Well, Google is a good example because it was in court on the feminist and for like being prejudiced against females and also on the conservative and for being prejudiced against conservative. It's like well, so both camps are out for the night. I think we'll why is that psycho? That's what happens when you play identity politics is tribalism, but this is really what I can't stand about identity politics and I've been warning about the consequences of our on the right wing to cuz what I see happening is that Does the left like let's say the left gets to define the linguistic territory, which was what I was objecting to a bill c16 when it came out.

I said look, I'm not going to use these neologism z&z Etc because as far as I'm concerned they have nothing people don't know what you're talkin about just made up gender pronouns in the non male or female when I tell her is like 70 different categories of non-binary gender something like that generated now and there's a list of pronouns that hypothetically the people who are in those categories can choose to be addressed by and now that has the force of Law and so and I don't care if they choose to be addressed by those pronouns, whatever that's that's that's that's up to them and whoever else they can convince or a screen treat or negotiate with fun as soon as it's law. That's a whole different story. Okay. So now I have to use a certain terminology. So then I look at the derivation of the terminology isao. That's terminology generated by the postmodern neo-marxist. Oh, well, I think those people are reprehensible a murderous. So guess what? I'm not going to say their words. Because I know what they're like, I know where that leads. Okay, so bumps on most people think that's a gigantic step take to go from saying you don't want to say zer0 and he's made up gender pronouns to these murderous Piedmont Urology is murderous in Marxism. Understand Marxism like when you when you were so adamant about it. I had it start reading about it myself and I had to start doing a lot of research about it myself and I think most people here Marxism and they think socialism they think pulling all your money together, you know, making, you know, making things more even for everybody.

The problem of kids starving to death in hospitals illegal for the doctors to report starvation as the cause of death. Right. Wow, that's Venezuela in a nutshell. Yeah, that was everyone's equal there the same number of bones to know on. Hey, that's a horrible thing. But yeah, it's it is a horrible thing undeniably, but there's no like the connection between gender pronouns and murder this. It's a big leak out. That's that's for sure sure. What that's why you have to look at the underlined ideologies, you know any steak while what's what level at? What is the level at which these things should be addressed while he's an economic. Is it political or is it personal things of these this ideology and you understand where the road map leads to understand the acts at the end of the road. Actually, there's a set of books that let lay this out perfectly read Dostoyevsky wrote a book called the possessed or the devils and it's a it's a description of the initial breakdown of the Orthodox Christian Society in in Russia in the late 1800s and the rise of radical socialist ideas. So it's sort of like the prodromal to the Russian Revolution to brilliant brilliant book and concentrate.

On the personalities that are involved and then if you read after that so much and it's in school like archipelago where he details what he just doesn't that book is quite remarkable. So he says look there were tens of millions of people killed from 1919 to 1959 in the Soviet Union and it as a consequence of internal repression and it's so Dreadful that words can't do it justice mean. It's absolutely Dreadful what happened in the Soviet Union. I mean to just for starters 6 million ukrainians died in the 1930s because of enforced starvation. In fact in in in the 1930s here is here's how it was. So all the food the collective Farmers newly collectivized Farmers had produced which wasn't very much by the way was taken from them and brought to the city's so the farmer starve to death some children and all your grades have been shipped off to the cities and you thought well, I'm not going to have my children starve to death. I'm going to go out in the field and I'm going to go on my hands and knees and I'm going to pick up the grains that are left. Or that the Harvesters didn't capped get and I'm going to feed those to my kids that was punishable by death. You were supposed to hand in those extra bits of green so that they could be shipped to the city as well. That was just the beginning of the fun in the Soviet Union and WorkSource. Nixon did was say look, this wasn't a consequence of the Marxist system gone wrong. This was a consequence of the Marxist system. It was inevitable consequence of the axioms of the Marxist system and any delays that out and it's I think you got it. Right and what is y when she'll Bell price but what is the connection? How much tyranny you have to impose in order to produce something like equality of outcome of the in Thomas Howells talked about this little bit agitated for equality of outcome don't understand is that you have to cede so much power to the authorities to the government in order to ensure equality of outcome that a tyranny is inevitable and that's right. No problem with equality of outcome. This is also a big technical problem is like well what measure of outcome You know, there's lots of outcomes like how happy are you? How much pain are you in? How healthy are you how much money do you have? How much opportunity for movement forward do you have? What's the width of your Social connections? Like what's the quality of your friendships? Do you have exposure to art and literature like, you know, you can multiply the number of dimensions of a valuation between people normally, right? Cuz it's all sorts of ways to classify people you going to get the equality of outcome on every one of those measures. It's like everyone going to have to be equally happy in the relationship. And if not, why not? What why why stop with economic why stop with pay? There's no place to stop showing that's it. Then that's a huge technical problem because there is no place to stop there will be no stopping like nobody can have anything else. Nobody can have anything that everyone else doesn't have at the same time. That's the ultimate outcome of equality of outcome. What you think about what that would mean. It's terrible. Why instantly you think I owe it? Well, there's nothing but a tyrannical system couldn't post that. Have you ever debated a Marxist Porter of your debated someone who is pro equality of outcome know, they don't debate me. The closest thing I think was to that was the debate. I did at the University of Toronto about the bill c16 issues. But if they didn't actually have a debate they had a forum which is the postmodern equivalent of the beta supposed to be friendlier I suppose but no I haven't because people don't do it. They don't ask me to do it. But what is it about that idea or that ideology about Marxism? That's so attractive to Young students and to University Park address like you might say well why is the left wing necessary but let's let's put it that way. So and then a subset of that would be wise the left-wing attractive. Will the left-wing is necessary because What does spiral out of control and there has to be a political voice for the dispossessed and you don't want people to stack up at zero, you know where they can't play the game at all. It's a bad idea. Not only do you not if PPL stock up at zero, they're too poor to get ahead at all. Let's say there to Port open a bank account there too poor to buy enough food like they're stuck at 0 and they can't get out of it. It's a really bad saying because first of all that's a lot of suffering and that's not so good second of all well at least in principle a lot of those people might be what might have something to offer the world or their children might and you want to open up Avenues of opportunity to them so that they can succeed but so did everyone else can benefit from their success. So and then the next thing is well if the inequality gets out of hand too much in the whole society starts to destabilize because if you get enough people stacked up at 0 special young man, you didn't know if young men stocked up at zero, they think oh to hell with it will just flip the whole board over and Settle in a new configuration and maybe we won't be stuck at 0 in the new configuration. So it's foments revolutionary thinking to his lots of reasons to be concerned about inequality. And so you need a voice on the left to say look we got to parameterize the the tendency towards inequality so that it doesn't destabilize the entire Society so that it's everybody has an opportunity to advance like yes, right you need that? Okay. So that's the technical reason for the necessity of the left and then I think its attractive because well because young people can be resentful partly cuz they're at the bottom of the Heap so to speak they're not cuz they're young like look you want to be you want to be pouring 18. You want to be rich and 80 What you going to choose and you can get back there that well, that's the thing, you know, most of the people who are have a million dollars or more in the United States are old. Well, why is that? Well, it's like you've had a lot more time to make money. I would that be that's the explanation. So that's one of the big drivers of inequalities just simply age but it's not obvious that the old rich people have an advantage over the Young starting out people. So so anyways, but any any help maybe you're resentful an irritated cuz you're young and you're still at the bottom of the heat, but you know, you've got other problems to it's more difficult for people of your race or ethnicity or gender. At least you think it is. And so you say well I want to make things fair and then that's also driven by some real compassion because nobody really likes that the consequences of radical inequality, like nobody likes the fact that homeless people exist and have to Go to the emergency Ward, you know what to get treated and they don't have medical coverage and they have to live in tents on the street. And so if you have some compassion, then you think while we going to do more for the poor and dispossessed. It's like, okay, that's that's an understandable sentiment but the problem is is that the people but the problem is is that it's not that bad desire to help is contaminated by resentment an idiot logical certainty and that also buy something that George Orwell pointed out so nicely in his book road to Wigan Pier. It's like the typical middle-class socialist. This was his diagnosis and he was a socialist by the way. His diagnosis was the typical middle-class intellectual socialist doesn't like the poor. In fact, they don't have anything to do with support their contemptuous of the poor, but they hate the rich and I think it's even more devious than that because I think who they hate are the successful. Some of the successful rich but really who they hate is too successful. It's it's like Cain and Abel it's the retelling of Cain and Abel and so there's some positive motivation for being engaged on the left and there's a lot of negative motivations as well. And the people who are really driven by the radical left ideologies. The real radicals are almost all driven by my resentment and hatred as far as I'm concerned the most extreme back to the idea of the of the radiological and verbal territory. I said with Bill c16 that I wouldn't speak the language of the radical leftist because I don't think that that language should Define the game but let's say it does so here's the game. The world is a battleground of groups and the they're battling for power. That's it. That's the game and some of them win and they oppress those who don't with so that's how we're going to be with the world. Okay. Now the left is say, okay. Well, here's the oppressed people the oppressors the patriarchy type pitcher archetypes. They should be ashamed of themselves and give up some power the right-wingers the radical right Wingers. Look at that new say, oh I see so the game is ethnic identity. Is it identity politics? Okay. We're white males. We're not going to lose. That's the right wing version of identity politics. It's like screw you if we're going to divide into groups before going to divided into tribes and I'm in my tribe. I'm not going to get all guilty and lose. I'm going to get all cruel and wind. And that's like men you think while there's people in the middle of their kind of looking back and forth which side of the identity politics Spectrum. I might get a fallen. Do I want to go with the do I want to go do I want to be driven primarily by compassion and I'm am I going to accept guilt for my historical privilege. So that's one possibility and then I'm the oppressor on the member of the oppressor group or am I going to say it with no tail without I'm just going to play it went. Well, then I'm going to go to the right. It's like what my sense is. How about we don't play either those games. And the reason we shouldn't play the mist or the Soviets play the left wing game and my killed who knows how many tens of millions of people you can't even counted accurately the estimates range from 20 to 100 million was a pretty big are Bart and that in the maoists maybe a hundred million certainly 60 million to okay that didn't work out. So well, then there's the Nazis like they played ethnic identity politics and racial superiority. Like why do we want to play that game? See what I've been trying to do. Really what I've been trying to do for the last 30 years. It's a look. There's heavy Temptations to play those sorts of games. But that's not the only game in town too much better game to play individual so I can get your act together stand up in the world make something of yourself. Stay away from the illogical over-simplification set your house in order. That's rule 6 in the in the Guinness book. So I have a book rule in there sis set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world and it's a very dark chapter about the motivations of the Columbine High School killers and this other guy named Carl panzram who is a serial rapist in arsonist in murderer and he wrote an autobiography and the Columbine kids also wrote about why they did what they did their resent to the core bitter bitter resentful terrible and Well, I'm suggesting that people stay away from that resentment resentfulness in bitterness even know life is hard and it and is malevolence in the world so I can yeah, you can you can tell a story where everyone's a victim because we all. We don't get sick, you know and and and things happen to us that are bitter and terrible betrayal deceit lies, like people hurt us on purpose. You know, it's not just the tragedy of Life its malevolence as well. It's everyone's a victim. You can tell that story the problem is if you tell that story to start to act it out you make all of that worse. That's the problem and it's so this is why I partly I got attracted to Christian imagery at least in part because there's an ID in Christianity that you should pick up your goddamn cross and like walk up the hill and that's Dramatically, that's correct. That's the right answer is like you got a heavy load of suffering to bear and a fair bit of its going to be unjust. What you going to do about it, except it voluntarily and try to transform as a consequence. That's the right answer the right answer cuz the rest of it is tribalism and we're too technologically powerful to get old tribal again. What's exciting to me is that I think this is the first time in my life that I've ever seen so much communication on these subjects and I think so much recognition about the consequences of tribal toxic tribalism this tribal thinking that everyone seems to be engaged in on the right and on the left. I mean in America, you need to go no further than going back and forth from CNN to Fox News to say something's wrong here. These are these are supposed to be news outlets have two completely different narrative and that has nothing to do with what we're talking about gender politics and and radical left socialism. Marxism what you're seeing and universities though is a radical departure from what I always considered University's great for but I always considered universities great for is separating from your parents challenging belief systems and being engaged in the works of brilliant people who you can compare all of their findings and their discoveries and and sit down and debate them in class. And when I was a kid when I was in high school, I went to a very good High School Newton South High School in Newton, Massachusetts. And one of the things that they did is they put on a debate between a guy from the Moral Majority, which was this right-wing Christian group that I'm not around anymore. But there is this was 19. I was fourteen. So 81 And a Barney Frank, who was the congressman is not one of the first openly gay guys in Congress and and you got to watch these two people in this Auditorium debate their points in this Moral Majority guy had this, you know, right wing Ronald Reagan sort of puke point of view and Barney Frank was kind of crazy got busted in some male prostitute Scandal and put the gay community. That's not that big of a deal and just took my part was brilliant to watch but it was a real debate was fascinating and he got to see a mediocre mind versus a great mind and you got to see this little thing and then I was like, wow this is and it was one of the things that's always attracted me about the The idea that two people with different viewpoints and get together in front of a neutral audience and these people can sort of decipher which which way these people are thinking and why they think yeah. Well that is that is in Rife with conflict that as that is the alternative is to separate as you pointed out into two camps that don't talk. Yes. Anything is the consequence of not talking is that you fight. 
========,9,title.
That's the end game because the only way you can stop from fighting with other people is by negotiating with them and you know, one of the things that's also interesting in this is partly why Silicon Valley leans to the left is that a fair bit of your political preference is determined by your biological temperament. It's a strongly influence. So if you're a creative type who's kind of disorderly, then you're likely to be on the liberal-left end of the distribution and if you're a non creative type who's orderly and and especially if your order Avenue Tempe on the right wing in to fix and so and well, why is that what why do those variations exist? Well, they exist because some of the time your best strategy is to do what other people have done and shut the hell up and just do it run the algorithm right the pathways already laid clear. It works stay in the damn right and move forward. Okay. So that's the conservative approach and when things are going right, it's the right approach. The problem is is that sometimes it's not the right approach because something has shifted its or something new has to emerge until then there's a bunch of people who are adapted to the new and those are the entrepreneurial and creative types. Of course, they dominate Silicon Valley because it's a very entrepreneurial it's a very entrepreneurial what would you call it geography and so they're going to lean to the left but they have to understand people have to understand that the left and the right need each other the Liberals and conservatives need each other liberal start companies conservatives run the And the problem with the concerned it is well, they can only run a company in One Direction cuz they're conservative. They don't think outside the box. But so if the company is working in the product line is good and everything is stable like some conservatives cuz they'll maximize efficiency in the move down that track but if the track is no longer going in a good direction because something's changed the environment change while then you got to bring in the creative people and so we can meet each other. The only way that we can survive the fact that were different and the fact that we need each other is by continually talking if talk constantly it's like well how much of what we're doing should we preserve versus how much of what we're doing should we transform and the answer is we don't know because the environment keeps changing. So what do we do about that?

We talked I was on a CBC Canadian Broadcasting Corporation interview couple of days ago and they took me to task I tweeted out this this invitation to the boys to fill out this program that I developed called future authoring and it helped. People make a plan to get there an online group there is but it's this fictional comedy. It's essentially we're going to we're going to be our ethnicity highly demonized before it would some individual examples of racism Nazism and you don't want to misbehave. The boys are the ones who are often using the Pepe memes for example, and you know, the left regards Pepe is a hate symbol copy that frog feels good frog frog and so I tweeted out that my said the check boys seek your 4chan. Rescue yourself from the underworld use code Pepe for future or 3. So it's pretty for 1 week. So they had to figure out what it meant. Then I showed this picture of Michigan jfrog, which is the frog from Old Warner Brothers cartoon dancing frog that wouldn't perform when it was watching it. So CBC hold that out and said well look, aren't you aren't you like appealing to the radical? Right? And I said well know what I'm doing. I said look beat these people are attracted by the radical right a little dirt satirists and juvenile satirists in graffiti types. And now they're they're playing a weird to have a turbo kit and my sense was well, what are you develop yourself as an individual and get the hell out of the ideological trap. So here's my program which helps you write about your future and that'll help you decide who you are as an individual cuz that's the way out of the ideological trap so I can absolutely obviously what's the way out of tribalism first. Toyota tribalism is not to never join a tribe. 
========,9,title.
You actually have to join a tribe as you mature, right? Because what happens is for throw your infant and then you have your parents to to make a relationship with but then when you move from your parents, you have your tribe you have your group maybe it's the music you listen to It's the gang you hang around with whatever you have to be socialized into the tribe you have to cuz otherwise you stay a dependent infant. Okay, but now you're socialized into the tribe was that where it ends like know the next thing to do is differentiate yourself from the tribe will still knowing how to behave within the tribe. Will that's the called individualism and that's I think what the West got right is that we figured that out is like you're more than your you have to be a member of a group because otherwise you're not socialized not good for anyone. You don't have to be able to play on a team man. You have to have Team loyalty. Okay, but that isn't where you should stop you should take the next step and become a fully developed individual and She the problem with being just a group member is that the group is the problem with conservatism the group is a fixed entity. It has its rules and its regulations. And if you remember that's all you are but the group can go badly wrong. So the group needs individuals to keep the group alive and revivify so you have to become an individual so you can revivify the group. That's the called that's the call in the last 2 to heroism essentially to Noble way of living is to develop yourself past your group identity so that you can reconfigure the game when that becomes necessary and I think that there's a very influential line of Developmental Psychology pioneered by Jean Piaget that laid that out is a developmental. What word progression? firstier Child, didn't you remember of a group that you're an individual so I get to the individual level that's the solution the solution to tribalism, but you have to accept responsibility to do that. And this is what your future authoring program is basically all about the man. It's it's a wonderful program. It send it along with this book rules and guidelines for life. 
========,9,title.
I think that's one of the things that a lot of young people are lacking is a structure to how to go about establishing who they are in the world have noticed when I be speaking publicly say over the last year-and-a-half because there's a hole in our culture where there should be a discussion about maturity truth and responsibility. No one's talking outside. Okay, so now I'll come out and I'll start talk about that. They look like what you do with your life will take care of yourself. But take care of yourself in the way that also means that simultaneously your take care of your family and that and also means that symbol taneously you're taking care of the broader Community. That's kind of your butt in the way that your success breeds success because if you're going to establish a name I noticed I was like a really good and that's a good one. Good for you too. Good for everyone else. Yes. Okay, that would give you life some meaning no adopt make a plan generator Vision. That's what the future authoring Program help people with makeup and develop a vision of what your life could be. Like if if it was worth living despite all its sufferings. Like what would you need so that you would be happy to be a lot you find your life meaningful so you don't get all bitter and resentful and cruel and hostile an idiot logically addled in like murderous and Jenna Seidel is like none of that you think real hard how would you have to configure your life? So that despite its suffering and the malevolence that's part of it that you would regard it as worthwhile. That's up to you to develop a vision then put a plan into practice. So when I talk to people about this the most of my audiences are young man. It's probably about 6535 more more women are showing up but that's about what it is right. Now. The Halls are dead silent. You could hear a pin drop because nobody said so clearly for like fifty years that almost all the meaning that you will need to get you through the hard times of your life is going to be a consequence of adopting responsibility not have rights and impulsive action in Polson Freedom rights. Yeah. Go on it Freedom. No problem even freedom to do impulsive things fine, but that isn't where you going to find the meaning that keeps you sustained through the storms of life that's going to be you take care of yourself. You take care of your intimate partner to take care of your damn family. You don't run off to take care of your community. You rescue the wisdom from the past you stand up straight and you be courageous despite the fact that life is tragic and tainted by malevolent. Like that's the that's ancient That's what that is an understanding of the structure and discipline and that you know, I am in a lot of ways both of those things. You described earlier. I'm in a lot of ways my mind is creative and I'm always sort of half paying attention to things but I'm also disappear, right and it's one of the reasons why I think I so relate to both sides of this issue because I could tell it was a reason to successful. I could have easily been some hardcore right-wing asshole. I'm a competition oriented person. I've been since I was a child, I grew up competing in martial arts tournaments and dads and you have to be a hard person to do that. You have to understand what discipline is but before that I was an artist I wanted to be a cartoon comic books. That's what I wanted to do. I wanted to be an illustrator if it wasn't for one bad teacher in high school to totally Scheid me away from art. I probably would have went into that as a as a living. 
========,9,title.
When I look at both sides, I see myself in both sides that you could relate to tremendously. Is this new testament line decades ago and I can never understand it. It's the line is the meek shall inherit the earth and I thought there's something wrong with that. Blind. It just doesn't make sense to me meet just doesn't seem to me to be a moral virtue. And so I did a series of biblical lectures this year like 15 of them. That was also a weird little experience that we can talk about but I was looking through the these these sayings these maxims and I was one of them to make sure all inherit the Earth but I've been using this site called Bible Hub and it's very interesting. It's very disorganized. Resting. So you have a Biblical line and then they they have like three pages of commentary on each line. And so because people have commented on every verse in the Bible like to the degree that almost unimaginable so you can look and see all the interpretations and all the translations and get some sense of what the Genuine meaning my fate and the line the meek shall inherit. The earth Meek is not a good translation or the word is moved in. This room is hundred years or so three hundred years or so since it was translated what it means is this those who have swords and know how to use them but keep them sheathed will inherit the world. And that's another thing I beat the big difference is so great. And so would like one of the things I tell young man to be a monster. You don't cuz everyone says why you should be harmless virtuous. You shouldn't do anyone any harm. You should sheets your competitive instincts. You shouldn't try to win, you know, you don't want to be too aggressive you want to be to assert if you want to take a back seat in all of that's like no. Wrong, you should be a monster and absolute monster and then you should learn how to control it. Do you know the expression it's better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war. Yeah, and that's exactly right. It's so when I tell young men that they think but lots of them are competitive agreeableness, you know, cuz that's part of being competitive temperamentally. So I guess there's something wrong with being competitive. There's nothing wrong with it. There's something wrong with cheating there something wrong with being a tyrant is something wrong with winning unfairly. All of those things are bad, but you don't want people to win what's the difference between trying to win and striving you want to eradicate striving? What's the uncomfortable feeling that people associate with losing when they have personally experienced it they look at losing as they they've been oppressed or they've been hurt or they don't understand his dad is the motivation for growth and one of the most beautiful things that I think a young person can get involved in is martial arts because martial arts teach you that in a way that very few things. The teacher wouldn't especially Jiu-Jitsu because Jiu Jitsu is so complex and there's so many possibilities to it that attracts a lot of really smart people if you think of Jiu Jitsu you would think of like brutish individuals engaging is hard martial art to go to a real good Jiu-Jitsu school. You see nerds you see a bunch of like really smart kids that really get obsessed with the possibilities of this physical language this physical language also teaches you the consequences of not working hard of not being prepared of not understanding positions of not doing due diligence doing the work and it's it's an amazing amazing scaffolding for developing your life. I see someone who never let losing stop and the idea that a single loss in a competition to somehow defeat is completely insane. First of all, well, let's say you're a hockey player in your good player and you Who's the tournaments like well, so what you played the game, you're increasing your skills. It's like there's always next time and one of the things that I've also been. telling people informing people about is the idea that life isn't a game. It's a series of games and the right ethic is to be the winner of the series of games and part of that means you while you learn how to be a good loser because win every single game. We also have to embrace those losses as learning experiences and the people that have never lost or afraid of losing their afraid of learning but you're afraid of that feeling that terrible feeling that you get from losing is so beneficial. It's dated me and so many ways like it's one of the reasons it also were the reasons why I talk so openly about bombing on stage and I tried to do it with other comedians. Are you I will always want to tell people yeah, I'm An established comedian. I've been a comedian for a long time. Let me tell you about like when I was 2 years in or 5 years in or or four years ago, I can we tell you about some horrible moments on stage where we went wrong just so you understand like those things took me to another place can't cuz I realize I don't want to ever feel that feeling again. And so I rent everything up and then I went back to work and I went over my notebooks and I went over my my recordings and I feel What I was doing wrong, and I tried to improve upon a but even if it wasn't for that horrible sick feeling that's the same feeling you get when you get tapped on Jiu-Jitsu class same feeling you get when you lose a martial art tournament or anyting else losing is important while you might also say like let's say that you can pick your you can pick your level of competition in life to some degree. Okay. So let's say you pick a level of competition where you're always winning check. What all that means is you picked the wrong level of competition us because you don't like let's say You're a Grand Master chess player and all you do is play amateurs and every night you go home and congratulate yourself and what a genius you are because you just stomp these people left right and center. It's like not a genius you're dim with what you should be doing is playing people who are beating you like well as much as you can tolerate, so maybe that's 40% of the time maybe to 60% of the time but that way cuz to be a winner you want to be disciplined you want to know what you're doing and then you want to be on the edge where your skills are being developed and if you're going to be on the edge where your skills are going to be developed. You're at a place where we're lost. We're losing is always a possibility because otherwise you're not pushing yourself beyond your current capacity. If so, what are the things that I've outlined in 12 rules for life is a theory of meaning because meaning as far as I'm concerned that sense of meaningful engagement is the antidote to malevolence and suffering essentially cuz you want to have a life. That's so engaging that you think despite the fact that I'm limited in that were mortal and that life is tragedy and there's evil in the world despite all that. This is worth doing and I think that there's a there's a technical meaning that that the genuinely exists and that's the meeting that you get when you're in a domain where you have some discipline and some skill. So you're laying out your confidence in and your your ability, but your symbol taneously pushing yourself to develop past where you are, that's really engrossing once I do it. What did that is doing is expand. Bring your confidence and so life is suffering and betrayal in in in many senses of the word, but you can adopt a way of traversing through life that is more powerful than the tragedy in the malevolence. I agree and I say too many people that what what is going on in your life as you have a series of human reward systems that are in your body and coded in your body and your genetics and it's the reason why human being survive to 2018. And in order to be happy, you have to feed those things. You have to feed all of them. You have to feed the one that wants to overcome difficult tasks. You have to feed the one that wants to solve problems. You have to feed the one that wants to be with a loving tribe of a people that you care about you have to feed the one that wants to procreate you defeat all these things. You have to feed the love. You have to feed the competition. You have to feed the discipline and that to me is the only way to stay balanced or with me with my body and my mind. That's the only way I've been able to stay balanced and when neither will any of those things get out of whack I get out of work. I also was so part of that is so imagine that so imagine that you're a loose collection of all these things that need to be gratified the need to be sad for a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it biologically. Okay. So now you have to conjure up a motive being that satisfies all those Necessities syml taneously, but then this is this is a technical explanation of why the postmodernist insistence that there's an infinite number of explanations turns out to be wrong. I need an infinite number of interpretations. There's a very finite number of viable interpretations. So the first constraint is what exactly what you just said you have these inner demons. Let's say all of which need to be satisfied, but they need to be satisfied in every particular way. Not only do they need to be satisfied today. But they need to be satisfied today in a way that doesn't interfere with satisfying the next week next month next year and in the decade so cuz there's no point in you betraying your your future self to gratify your present self brunch a stupid game. Okay, so you're constrained by the necessity of satisfying yourself but of maintaining that satisfaction across time, but then it gets even more that's hard enough, but it's like there's an infinite number of used extending indefinitely into the future and all of them have to be satisfied simultaneously, but then it's worse because it isn't just you. Do you have to figure out how to gratify all those internal demons in a sustainable way in a way that other people not only don't object to but probably help you with and it benefits them at the same time. Will then you say you think ball there just aren't that many ways of solving that problem and we know some of them one of them is reciprocity. You don't like if you go out of your way for me. It's in coming on me to notice that Had to attempt in some manner to to repay you and like if if we're good friends, that's what we'll do if we're good brothers. That's what we'll do if that's what you do with your wife. It's a reciprocal Arrangement and that keeps things flowing properly across time. So there is done. There is an ethic this in this is the answer to the postmodern conundrums. Like what is life meaningless is everything just Nile Nile is is nihilism the right answer or maybe you know, what the what do you call identification with an etiology as a counter position to nihilism. So nihilism is wrong life is Meaningful nothing. That's what 12 rules for life is about. The first meaning of life is suffering and malevolence indisputable realities. Okay. Well, what's what's after that while there's a noble way of being that allows you to exist properly despite that and also not to make it worse. So can your life be meaningful enough so that you what is it? confront chaos voluntarily establishing revivify order Constrain malevolence, that's a good 3 part Doctrine for life, there's things to do and so that's what I've been talking to the audience is that I've been seeing over the last year. It's like get your act together stand up for threadly that's rule 1 stand up straight with your shoulders back. There's a vulnerable position, right? Cuz you're open but it's a powerful position because it means that you're brave enough to take what's coming in like what's coming isn't dangerous. It's dangerous. So but your best bet is to be dancing on your feet ready for it to pay attention to be awake and to treat yourself property that's real to figure out how to treat yourself as if you're someone worth coming to the aid of to detach yourself in a bit and say, okay. I'm going to set up my life so that it's good for me and good for other people as well as that's a corollary to that so the book is all about all about The meanings of Life the negative meanings suffering malevolence, those are indisputable realities and then a mode of being that integrates the sorts of things that you were talking about these underlying needs with everyone else's and like doing that voluntarily. It's a call to responsibility and meaning and I actually think it's not the thing that's being so exciting for me for the last three decades looking into these things is that I believe that there is a genuine human ethic. It's not arbitrary has to do with reciprocity for example has to do with honesty. That's not speak the truth cuz your life turns out better if you speak the truth. And so does everyone else so in this biblical lecture series I did I looked at the first chapter in Genesis. And here's a theory in their three interesting Theory a theory is that there's three parts to being there's chaos and potential and that would be like the potential you should live up to cuz everyone says, well, you should live up to your potential. What the hell is that? You can't measure it or touch it taste it feel it. It's this hypothetical thing that everyone regards is real. It's like it's like the future. What's the future? What's not here yet? You can't measure it but makes you think it's real well. We act as if it's real and that seems to work there's a there's so there's potential that's one that's KLX chaotic potential then there's order and that's the structure that you need in order to to confront the chaos. And then you be born with that biologically and then there's your ability to to call forth from the potential new order. That's what you do with your speech. That's what that's what happens in the first chapter of Genesis is that God uses God order. 
========,9,title.
Let's say uses the power of truthful speech that's the logos to transform potential into order and that's what people are made in the image of so, there's this Theory it's a lovely Theory that's laid out right at the beginning of the Bible that says that if you tell the truth you transform the potential of being into a habitable actuality. That's how it works. So it's a well how do you want it? How do you make the world better? Tell the truth? Cuz the world you bring into being as a consequence of telling the truth will be a good world. And I believe that's true. I think it's true metaphorically. I think it's true theologically and I think it's true like at the Practical and scientific level as well. I think it's true in all those levels simultaneous that's been ridiculously exciting to to sort through. I think this notion and one of the things that you said that I think really resonates is that there's not a voice out there that is advocating for responsibility and that is talking about how important it says and I think this is an inherent principle that most people are kind of aware of and it feels good to them to hear I could resonate see you feel it you even when you when you're saying that's clean your room and I'll put your house in order to like yeah. Yeah. How come I'm not hearing this right here is especially the social psychologist is push this idea of self esteem. You should feel good about yourself. And I think why would you tell someone 20 that so you should feel good about who you are so I know you shouldn't why should you feel good about who you are? So you should feel good about who you could be. That's way better cuz you got 60 years to turn into who you could wait a minute. Are you what your accomplishments are or are you just individual going through this journey, and I don't think there's anything wrong with feeling good about who you are as long as it's tempered by an understanding of potential and what you have accomplished versus what you can accomplish Having confidence is a big part of confidence. But like often you take young people say there are 16 to 22 and they're not really feeling not good about who they are chaotic in in disorder. They don't know where they're going and that they don't know which way is up because of the could be bad parenting, so we ain't got to be a lot of abuse going on and I think that's one of the reasons why Pete that resonates with people this idea of be happy for you about who you are feel good about who you are. It has to be stated with Precision. It's like yes, it's like you should treat yourself as if your valuable especially that was Angela, but you should concentrate on who you should become especially if you're young and so let's say you're miserable and nihilistic and chaotic and depressed and all of that now and you have your reasons, you know, terrible parenting abuse all of those things. It's like well, you should feel good about yourself. It's like no no, It's more like you should understand how much potential there is within you to set that straight and then you should do everything. You can to manifest that in the world and it will set it straight and that's better than self-esteem is like your ear in a crooked horrible position. Okay, fine. There's a lot of suffering and pain associated with that. Yeah, you can't just feel good about that because it's not good, but you can do something about it. You can genuinely do something about it. And I take all the evidence suggests that that's the case. So I'm telling telling young people. Look there's no matter how bad your situation is. I'm not going to pretend it's okay. It's not okay. It's tragic tainted with malevolence and some people really get hurt by malevolent people like, you know, terribly hurt. Sometimes they never recover. It's really awful, but there's more to you than you think and if you stand up and face it with with a positive with a with a noble Vision with discipline and intent you can go far farther to overcoming it then you can imagine and that's the Principle upon which you should predicate your behavior and I think that one of the things that's really nice about being a clinical psychologist is that this isn't just guesswork like one of the things we know two things in Clinical Psychology. What is truthful conversations redeem people cuz if you come to a clinical psychologist, it was worth his salt you have a truthful conversation the conversation is here's what's wrong with my life. And here's would cost if you know maybe takes a year to have that conversation and both of the participants are doing everything they can to lay it out properly. Here's how it might be fixed here is what a beneficial future might look like. It's about to completely honest conversation if it's working well and all the tapping in the conversation is that the two people involved are trying to make things better? That's the goal. Let's see if we can have a conversation that will make things better. Okay, so we know that works it does make things better. And then another thing we know is that well, let's say there's a bunch of things that you're afraid of that are in your way. So you have some Vision about who you want to be. Maybe you have to you know, you want to be successful in your career. So you have to learn to talk in front of a group. It's like, okay. Well you're afraid of that. So no wonder you don't want to be humiliated. So, okay. So what do we do about that? Well, maybe we first get you to speak in front of one person and then three people, you know for 5 minutes and then for 10 minutes like graduated exposure to what you're afraid of voluntary graduated exposure to what you're afraid of is cured. That's true. It works. The documentation is in its how people learn so so to to to tell people that if you confront the world forthrightly if you speak the truth and you expose yourself courageously to those things that you're afraid of that your life will improve and so will the life of people around you like as far as I'm concerned that's as close to undeniable fact is we as we've got and it also don't Tails nicely with the underlying archetypal stories that heroic story. It's like go out there find a dragon confront it it's a dragon it might eat you it's dangerous, but it's worse to cower at home and wait for it to come and devour you go out there confronted get the gold share it with a community like yeah, it's the oldest story of mankind. I think one of the factors in the resistance of these ideas of discipline and of taking responsibility for yourself and have a lot of the things you've been saying in regards to, you know, all the things we discussed earlier is people recognizing that they're not doing that in their own lives. And they get upset and instead of looking internally. They tried to attack the thing that's upsetting them. They did attack your message. They attack the philosophy behind it rather than look internally an objective and having some sort of introspective point of view where you okay, am I reacting to this because this is resonates like I'm missing this aspect of my life it is this guy is this diminish me or is this guy pointing something out that I can benefit from very few people are willing to do that very few people are willing to take that critical moment to look at their own behavior and look at their own thought process in wonder if the actual adverse reaction they have to this person's message is because they know that they're wrong reasons for that.

What is well, What makes you think that you're someone we should listen to I was like hey there enough, you know, so you got to be poked a bunch to see if that's true. And then the next thing is well, it's it's painful to understand how much of what you're doing isn't productive so I'll give an example. So I've done this a couple of times with class was full of students. Usually when I'm lecturing about Career Development say, okay, how much time do you waste so that I could get the class to vote? How many of you waste 10 hours a day is like 10% of the kids are put up for hand and it's interesting cuz I don't Define what constitutes waste I just asked the question. So there are diagnosing themselves, right? I'm not saying you're wasting 10 hours a day. I'm just asking it's like giving your own attitude how much time are you wasting 10 hours a day is like 10% of the people put up their hands while when you get to like 6 hours a day 80% of the people put up their pants. So then we do the arithmetic It's like because I like doing arithmetic. People hate arithmetic, but I like doing it like okay 6 hours a day. It's 42 hours a week. So it's called out of work week 40 hours a week. So so that's not to work week. Let's say what's your time with your University student was certainly worth minimum wage cuz obviously but it's worth way more than that because if you spend a productive hour when you're 20, then you gain the benefits of that hour for the rest of your light. So there's the compounding effect of time spent when we are young. So let's assume your time is worth fifty bucks an hour, which I think is under estimate then whatever. Let's call it 50. We called 25, but we'll call it $52,000 a week. You're wasting a year. How much better? Would your life be if you weren't wasting $100,000 a year? Check what is that over 40 years $4000000. It's like you're rich. You don't even know it quit wasting time by your own definition. It's like people shake their heads that way. It's like ya think about it. That way don't waste your damn life. And then you think we'll why would people be resistant to that message. It's like, well you really want to wake up and figure out that you're wasting half your life, you know, when people do that kind of wasting they actually hate it, you know that I've had lots of people come to my clinical practice who were chronic procrastinator, you know, when still there Watching YouTube videos say but not ones that are good for them. Although sometimes they will do that. But just browsing and that kind of mindless way that you do when you're not paying attention and you're trying to kill time people doing that. They feel bad to get depressed. They feel anxious. They can't get away from that. They feel kind of Quasi addicted. That's what they're saying about social media now to do with young kids absolutely this feeling of kind of internal rot and Corruption that goes along with it. So I guess yeah. Well you're wasting your life is like so it's painful it's painful to recognize that then it's painful to think. Oh my god. Look how undisciplined I am. I don't know anyting. I can't use a schedule. I can't I can't stick to a calendar. I don't have any Ames. I don't know anything about the world right and maybe there's a part of me. That's bitter because I haven't got everything already and I'd like just like to say to hell with it. That's the recognition of the Union Shadow. So that's what makes you vicious and and and and untrustworthy all of that. No one wants to look at that. nobody Wonder but Hey, the alternative is worse. So the problem is you sent it like just saying you just stop wasting your life. Like I think that that's not enough. I think this is one of the reasons why book like this is so important like the idea of discipline and most people's eyes. It's like if you're not a disciplined person, it's uncomfortable. It's it's going to be painful. It's it's frustrating that you have to force yourself into these things. It's a muscle to and it's a muscle that has to be developed. These patterns have to be developed in your own mind simply. Yes. You're right. Just telling people not to waste it lives is not enough and this is not a reason why I'm so much enjoyed being a clinical psychologist because clinical psychologist don't stick with high-level abstraction, especially the behavior. So pretty practical. It's like, okay you want to get your act together. It's like well, how about if let's say you're not studying. Well, and so we do a real analysis of how much you starting you say when I go to the library for hours a day is like yeah. Yeah. Okay. How much time do you actually study in the library? Well, you know I waste time I have to travel there. I look at my phone. It's like, okay. Well how much 15 minutes half an hour? How much is real studying while maybe we figure out its 15 minutes. So, okay. So what you going to do for 1 week is you're going to study for half an hour. That's all you don't get to go to the library for 4 hours. You have to sit down and we'll figure out a time 10 in the morning. Whatever will put in your schedule try to study for half an hour no more and then just come back and let's have a conversation about how well that worked and people come back and say well, you know how I managed it for days and one day I went over and one day I can do it at all. It's like okay that's better instead of 75 minutes of study in 15 minutes a day for 7 days. What is that 1570 hundred five minutes, you've managed about 210 minutes so that you've already produced in a 50% your bumbling horrible way. 50% Improvement one week like that's deadly. It's like in the future authoring program.

What we ask people to do is think about your life along 6 dimensions. What do you want for your so that the goal is that she's going to take care of yourself. You don't have a life in three years that justifies its suffering. That's the goal. So you can invent the damn life, but you have to think what you would be satisfied with so you wouldn't be all bitter and resentful. It's like, okay. What do you want from your family? What do you want from your friends? Korean educate yourself. What do you want for your career? How are you going to use to time outside of work? How are you going to handle drugs and alcohol and other Temptations like that are going to keep yourself mentally and physically healthy. These are open questions like you get tan ideas. You can have whatever you want. But you have to figure out what it is has to be realistic and have figure out what it is. It's okay. So now develop a vision what's your life going to be like in three to five years? So you write down then we do something else, which is okay. Your bad habits in your resentment in your bitterness and all of that your procrastination gets completely out of hand and yauger down and you're in your own personal version of Hell in 3 to 5 years. What is that look like everyone else that looks like everyone can look in the future and think well if I keep going on this dark path, this is where I'll end up with any thought little hell outline for yourself to run away from you got a little head outline for yourself to run to Wards and then you're motivated because sometimes you know, you're just hopeful I would like a good thing to happen. It's like yeah, but you know, I'd like to drink whiskey tonight to it's like so which is it going to be well just being hopeful about the future might not be enough but then you think oh, oh I see like there's that little hell thing that I Old Line this waiting for me and maybe I'm afraid of taking the next next step forward cuz it's demanding and challenging. It's like, yeah, I'm afraid that but I'm way more afraid of where I might end up if I don't get my act together and people should be that's why their conceptions of hell and so many religion. It's like hell is real place. Whether it's Eternal, that's a whole different question. Whether it's waiting for you in the afterlife. That's a whole different question. But if you've never met anyone in hell, you haven't lived very long. You haven't had your eyes open and it's undeniable that did that feeling of total complete misery undeniable, especially when it's compounded by the fact that you know, you did it to yourself. That's the real fun. That's the real fun part. It's like I'm having a bit of a time and I richly deserve it Jesus that's rough mass is another concept that is doesn't have a voice right now. This is another I mean, this is a giant part of being human being instead of identity politics and right vs left. I think these these right vs left battles often times. What they are is a simply that the Battle Ground for the conflicts in your own mind better to have the conflict in yourself. That's another thing. I really learned. Well not not only from the New Testament but a fair bit from that know the idea is that Does evil in the world of all sorts and some of its steveland other people and some of its the evil in your brother's heart, but the the part of it that you can really do something about that's the malevolence in your own heart. You can actually do something about that and that's actually way more useful than you think. So because if you can face it in you then you start to understand it and that also makes you strong enough to identify them to fight it when you see it in the external World Plus you don't do any harm. It's like like there's lots of people all over the world going out and doing reprehensible things. You might say why you should go in protest against them. Sometimes you should but most of the time you should think we're am I falling short of the ideal my own ideal doesn't have to be one that someone puts on you. Where am I less than I should be. Where am I bitter? Where am I making the world a worse place than it has to be like you ask yourself those questions. You'll be in for a big shock say what would happen if you stop doing that that's what 12 rules for life is about. It's like stop saying things that make you weak. Stop telling lies that you know to be Lies start doing things, you know to be used with some counterproductive aim high top some responsibility and then see what the hell happened so I can work and that's what I'm hoping. People will do ya. I'm hoping people do that too. And I think if more people live their life in this sort of a manner, I think we're going to have a less differences and turns of our ideologies and more of an understanding that people have different ways of looking at things different ways of living and this this combat between people this this internal strife that manifests itself in this combat between ideologies. I think you are much more inclined to let other people live their lives. If you're living your life in a satisfactory manner that that's exactly it. That's a good that I have a chapter in there on raising kids says don't like your kids. Don't let your kids do anything that makes you just like them. Psychonauts first predicated on the observation that you're quite a monster and it would be better for your kids if they didn't get on your bad side and like it again because I'm a clinical psychologist said his monster.

Why why why do you use that term families? Like I've seen families where it's as if every single person in the family has their hands around the neck of the family member that's close to them and they're squeezing but only tight enough to strangle it been 20 years, but you're not always using as a pejorative you you've also used it. You should become a monster. You should be a monster you shouldn't be it shouldn't be That's the thing was so what do you mean by monster than in a positive sense? Like you should be a Monster High part of the monster somebody who says no and means it cuz when you say know what you mean is, there isn't anything you can do to me that will make me agree to do this. Why isn't a monster because you have to be because no one will take you seriously. Otherwise, I'll take you seriously like no means if you keep pushing this something that you do not like will happen to you. That's what no means. You don't have any strength of character unless you can put up a fight in order to be able to say no to something is to be able to put up a fight. So when you can do that, if you're if you can be pushed around you just get argued into submission or you'll feel guilty cuz you're causing conflict or something like that but isn't there confusion using those terms as a positive and a negative? Maybe there's another word instead of monster. There is there is the potential there is the potential for confusion. You say well, is that something that can be is that a good monster is a horrible thing. I don't think of it as being like a wall like someone who is just a rock solid in their belief system and rock solid and their understanding of themselves to fight someone who's formidable. Say, what do you think of the person that you're fighting? Like how would you characterize them whenever monster side because they can take their they can they can bring physical. Substantial physical Force to bear on the situation and Andy be willing to do it. So they're not naive and and Carlos by any stretch of the imagination, right? They have a well-developed nasty for Mayhem. You say qualities that monstrous it's like well, I would say yes, I would say fierce fierce fine. Let's go without someone who's Fierce and formidable. It's not necessarily a monster. You know, it's just I think of a monster is being just an awful person is done awful things. Just you know, which race with your kids while you definitely don't want to have your kids act in a way that awakens your inner monster. That's put it that way and so you need to you need to organize your family with a certain amount of discipline in a certain amount of structure so that you get to do what you want which is back to back to the point that you made earlier so that you're happy to have your kids around so that you won't take revenge on them. And so you want to lay your life out so that Well so that it's providing you what you need to not be bitter and to work for your best interests and for the interests of everyone else. That would be lovely and I think it's attainable you don't because the book is very dark and I'm a very dark guy in some ways because I've looked at the terrible things that people do to one another that says a fascinating way of looking at you think of yourself as dark cuz I don't I don't think of you as well. That's good. I'm just seeing what you're very friendly guy. I think you're you're very serious and especially about these very complicated issues. And I think that's one of the reasons why you have made this gigantic wave in online discourse in their people discussing these very tumultuous times we live in is cuz you're a guy that did extrapolate your guy did look at that c16 bill and look at Marxism and go. Do you know where this is headed and you were the guy that had the courage to say murderous and then people are what the fuck is he? Talking about that doesn't make any sense and you had to spell it out and explain it and when you do you realize why this is so significant to you earlier doesn't seem to be all of that. What would you say debatable that if we degenerated into tribalism, the probability of Bloodshed becomes vastly enhanced so I call that always happens when the voltage tribalism someone I'm pointing to a particular kind of tribalism. I guess the darkness is that you know, I'm very aware of the terrible things that people not only are likely to do to each other but do do do each other all the time. I mean, what about 40% for divorce rate, right, but it's time to divorce 40% Maybe maybe it's 50% here somewhere on I want but yeah, yeah, you have to go through a lot. Tell you don't want Chris Rock joke about that. He's like 50% of people get divorced who goes he goes, but that's just that people had the courage to leave. It was how many cowards just stay and suffer and meanwhile in that wind up getting divorced a few years later and right horrible divorce. So yeah true story. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we need more people who are actualize human beings more and more people who understand themselves more people who have gone through adversity both in real life and personal in terms of their understanding of their own growth of their own potential and their own understanding of how they've managed their their life their mind their their actions. And the more we have people that have personal sovereignty the better we'll we'll be able to have these these conversations 12 suggesting to people is that they pick something difficult to do read this is funny little paragraph by Kierkegaard was written about 1840 and he was thinking about his role as a student and writer he was a student and writer forever, you know, he never really had a career apart from that and he said that he wasn't one of these people who was capable of inventing something wonderful to make life easier for everyone. So many people were doing and I wanted it during the Industrial Revolution. He said well, maybe I'm one of these people whose benefit to society will be that I will make things more difficult for everyone because there will come a time. When what people want. They don't want these they want difficulty instead and I think what that is what people want that is what they want. You think while I want an easy happy life. It's like no actually that is what you want and see what one is things that are difficult that they can overcome anything when you overcome something when you do something difficult, whether it's I mean, I've never written a book but I assumed when you write a book when you're done writing that book there's a great feeling of accomplishment cuz it's very difficult to do that feeling of a combat for me. It's like when I put together a comedy special or when I you know, just anything this difficult. There's a feeling like I did it. I don't see why that feeling exists. You know, it's a genuine it's not a trivial thing that it's to say I did something different. And that was worthwhile basically what you're saying to yourself as well. There was a lot of suffering attendant on that along with the gist General suffering of life, but it turned out that was worth it. That's what you want is like you want that sense that you're engaged in something that's worth it and I say what I like I do I try to I'm not up like a casual optimist about these sorts of things mean. One of the things I do in 12 rules for life is lay out the rational the drives people like the Columbine High School Killers, cuz I understand that Russian El I've started it for a long time. I know why they did what they did and they have a powerful argument but it's wrong but you don't there's no sense in showing how its wrong before showing that it's a powerful argument like light life is suffering. There is lots of malevolence. It's no wonder that people want to bring being itself to a whole I want to take revenge on it's not surprising. It's the wrong way of going about it. 
========,9,title.
The right way is its way into the sorts of things that you were just observing it take on a difficult task but pushes you past where you Already you succeed in it. You get this sense that yes, that was worth while it's like that's what you want. You want to live in that place where things are worth. Well, that's Paradise on Earth. That's what that is and it isn't some happy little place where if you know someone's feeding you peeled grapes that isn't what it is. It's it's more like it's my life more like Victory on The Honorable Battlefield or something like that. You have the perception that people have of ultimate success in Ultimate happiness is it seems motivated by what they don't have rather than an understanding of what success and happiness really is there their idea? Is that one day I'm going to go and I'm going to be in my golden years and I'm just going to be able to sit around and do nothing until everybody to fuck off. You won't be happy at all. I talked to edit like a vision for retirement. So but what's your vision for retirement? Well, I see myself in the beach, you know some tropical country drinking margaritas and I thought our first that's what I plan. Let's go through this. All right, so you go down to this tropical country and you go sit on the beach and you have a margarita. It's like, okay. Well how many Margaritas like 10? Okay. It's going to do that for 6 months. You'll be dead. You'll be this like pathetic sunburned like fad supersonic Burrito on a beach like maybe you can do that once every 6 months for like 10 minutes something like that. It's true. But when you are working and slaving away you think about that beach with your feet up and and the waiter comes over. Would you like another Margarita? Mr. Peterson, but it's it's like this sixteen-year-old fantasy of you and it just doesn't work out so that sustains people through life really is the lifting of a worthwhile burden. It's something like that. It's probably cuz we're social animals, right? Just like we evolved to be useful to the people around us because they're much more likely to let us live if we're like that so it's been very fun talking to especially talking to young men about this is like well and that's the other thing to do is I think the world the world is full of Darkness. Let's say and we could say each of us have a little bit of light and if we release that light if we let it shine properly Christ. It's too cliched. one with in some sense, but the world is a lesser place. If you do not reveal from within yourself what you have to reveal and the fact that the world is a lesser Place actually turns out not to be trivial. Like if you wanted everything you could be more people will die more people will suffer more evil will be unconstrained more. Tyranny will rain more chaos will remain chaotic and dangerous all of that in a sense of like the old proverb of the wings of a butterfly fluttering become a hurricane. More messed up than it could be if you were less messed up then you are right. So if you just got your act together, like 10% more your family would be 1% Better would rip you off instead of people that they interact interactive course. What is 7 billion of us in each of us is just a separate dust mote like floating in the cosmos and what the hell difference does it make what you do anyways, like that is not how we're connected. It's like you're the center of a network and you know, well, you know way more people than this but let's say typically, you know, what's out you going to do a thousand people in your life. Well enough to have an impact on them. Okay. I need to know what styles and people is going to know. What's how some people so you're one step from a million Two Steps From a billion and we are network technically that that's how human interactions work. And so when you do something that you shouldn't do it's worse than you think. 
========,9,title.
And when you do something that you should do it's better than you think and so you think well, this is why I've been telling people clean up your room. So I call your room is actually Network to it's not that easy to clean up your room to set it. So you want your room to be set up so that when you walk in there, it tells you to be better than you generally are. It's organized. It's got Direction everything's in its place you try to do that in a chaotic household. Can I watch people do this? Cuz I had students do these sorts of things as a sign that said say look pick a small moral goal clean up your room and just write down what happens as a consequence. So maybe these are students in a chaotic household. The whole place is a bloody mess. No one's taking responsibility for anything. And so they decide they're going to start to clean up the room. And then the people in the house will notice on the first thing they do is get pissed off so I can go do you think you are like you think you're better than us? Like, why do you think this is worthwhile Who Made Who died and made you God all of that. So just by trying to or This little part of their life. They immediately run into the people whose actions there casting in a dim light by trying to improve themselves to some degree. They might have to have like a throw war in their household to be allowed to do something as simple as Keeping Room orderly the find a very rapidly that a that's way more difficult than it sounds and be that the consequences of it are far more far-reaching than people think that's quite fun. No cuz maybe part of it is isn't it? Like everything around you is full of potential everything maybe more potential than you could ever possibly utilize it. So maybe all you have is this little rat hold of a room in some run-down place in the world. It's like fixed up. There's more than you think see what happens if you fix it up and you'll fix yourself up symbol taneously cuz you have to get discipline in order to fix up the room. Then you have a fixed up room and you'll be a more fixed up person. It's like you think that nothing will happen as a consequence of that like all hell break loose as a consequence of that it is we're trying and it's it's a concept that seems alien to people but if you think about it, it makes sense, but people don't take what they have right in front of them. Seriously enough. It's like the wasting time thing.

They don't do the arithmetic, you know, when they'd also don't understand they devalue what they have right in front of another another client. I worked with was having a hard time putting his kid to bed at night. And so we did the arithmetics like well, I'm fighting with my kid for 45 minutes a night trying to get him to go to bed. Okay. So let's analyze that alright. So what does that mean? What means that both of you end the day upset? That's not so good. Cuz why would you want that? It means that you're spending 45 minutes fighting when you could spend 20 minutes doing something positive like reading to him say means that you don't get to spend that time with your wife. So she's not very happy with you. Plus you're annoyed because you don't see her plus you blame it on the kid because he's the proximal cause like that's pretty damn ugly. And then and then let's do the arithmetic. It's like 7 days a week 45 minutes a day. Let's call that 5 hours 20 hours a week 240 hours in a year at 6 your spending a month and a half of work weeks fighting with your four-year-old son think you're going to like them. You don't like anyone you spend a month-and-a-half a year fighting with it's a bad idea fix it. It's important get him to bed. Make it peaceful. You do it it like these things that repeat every single day. That's a motif in this book to your life isn't Margaritas on a beach in in Jamaica that happens now and then those are exceptions your life is how your wife greets you at the door when you come home everyday. Cuz that's like 10 minutes a day. Your life is how you treat each other over the breakfast table cuz that's an hour and a half for an hour every single day. You get those mundane things right those things you do everyday you concentrate on them and you make them pristine. It's like you got 80% of your life put together. These little things that are right in front of us. They're not little that's the first thing they are not little and they're hard to set right if you set the right, it has a Rippling effect and and fast to way faster than people think I want to talk about the Rippling effect, cuz I know you got to get out of here at 1 but I want to talk about the Rippling effect that you have had on people and how the hell that makes you feel me you were relatively unknown just a year-and-a-half two years ago, and now you have become I mean for lack of a better term, you're an online celebrity and you or your reach is fantastic. Now this thing that you were talking about about how your impact can affect the people around you in a knot versus a not-insignificant way very significant went. 
========,9,title.
What is that been like for you and what is that adjustment then? Like I said, I haven't adjusted to it. How old doyou 5500 for 53 years, you're relatively Anonymous other outside of University public television station in Canada. And you know, I had my little flashes of public appearances. That's what are paired to know. Yeah, that's just crazy what you've done on this show me and millions and millions of people have listened and watched each each individual episode 2 million views each end. And then that's nothing compared you to a YouTube is nothing compared to the audio. The audio was like five times that or something so that's completely crazy. I know I haven't adjusted to it. So I got it. I mean, have you adjusted to your status? Cancel. What's the weather like when you think about it you wake up in the morning and he's like, okay. I'm going to get a billion downloads this you don't think that I think I'm going to talk to Jordan Peterson what I want to talk to you about. That's that's how I handled it exactly the same thing for the last 15 months. This is what I've done going up in the morning. I've looked at this like 25 things I have to do in a mad rush before 7 at night. I think I'm going to go through them and I'm going to concentrate on them do the best job. I can then it's 7 tonight and go to have a rest. I'm going to take a look what I have to do tomorrow and I'm going to do the same thing. That's what I've been doing. And when I stand back a little bit like when it's sort of Dawns on me, you know, then it's disconcerting I could see real I can't figure it out. I can't understand it. But then I but there's no sense dwelling on that because First of all, I don't know how to conceptualize. I don't know why it's happening. Exactly. Like I think what's happened is that two things one is that I said it there was something I wouldn't do with regards to this legislation and I meant I actually meant it. I wasn't going to use those words under legal compulsion. No matter what and I actually meant that so there was that but then I think the more relevant thing is that I've been studying these old stories archetypal stories for a very long. Of time and they have power they really have power and they manifest themselves everywhere. They manifest themselves in movies and then books I mean Harry Potter's a mythological story and it made Roland richer than the Queen of England in all these stories have power and I was fortunate enough to study of large number of people large number of Scholars who knew what that power was Carl Jung in particular and I could make it more accessible to people and so that's a big part of it. But what the overall significance of that is but I just it just leaves me speechless minutes Cathy Newman things are good example, and I mean so many things have happened. I've got involved in the scandal of some sort. Serious Scandal of some sort probably every 3 weeks for a year-and-a-half, you know, there's things that are just all the James D'Amore thing is a good example of that. Like that's a big deal, you know that explosion that emerged around him in the court case that's coming out of it. It's a big deal and this thing with Lindsay Shepherd. That was the worst Scandal that ever hit a Canadian University and then there was all the protesting in any wars what happened with with channel for the UK and it's like I don't know what to make of it. I don't what what I'm trying to do is Have a good conversation when I come and talk to somebody like you where we can have a good conversation. Try not to say anything stupid. That's really what I'm trying to do is to not say anything stupid that's hard or too stupid to speed high stakes poker in 04. It's not quite so bad now because especially after what happened with Channel 4 and some journalists, like people have been trying to take me out for quite a long time and it's not it isn't working. So far, you're actually you actually believe what you're saying and actually makes sense charge time this toxic tribalism that we keep bringing up. It's the people's decisions tilt the world towards heaven or hell. I think there's no more accurate way of describing the consequences of each of your decisions been that you face potential. That's what you face. That's what your face in the world is potential. It's not Material reality its potential and every decision you make your deciding whether you want to make the world better or worse and if you like the ultimate better is heaven and the ultimate worse as hell. We know how to make the world into hell we do we've done that multiple times much of the 20th century was that it's like I looked at all that and I thought okay, I would rather The world didn't degenerated to hell and I understand why people wanted to degenerate into hell. They're angry. They're angry because they suffer they suffer unfairly and they suffer because people hurt and so they think this is a bad game. I'm not going to help make it better. I'm angry. I'm going to make it worse even that's what the Columbine kids tip & Oh that's what all the mass Shooters do they say to hell with this. I hate it there so far behind. I just want to flip the table over at worse than the game as much malice as possible just to obtain revant and I understand that but I decided a long time ago that I would rather not play that game. I think it's I think that it's possible that we could make the world better. I really believe that he's at 2, so I think we can try to tell people look. There's more to you than you think there's more potential. There's more than enough potential to go around. There's definite suffering in the leveling sand the world we could fix it. You haven't got nothing better to do. That's a very big point that has more potential to go around more than people understand. The famine thinking is one of the reasons why people get upset at other people's success, they seem somehow or another this other person success take something away from them people actually act like what they confront in the world is potential. It's so funny because whatever potential is it's not materially measurable. But if you tell someone you're not living up to your potential they go What what is that potential that you're not living up to and then when you say well there's potential in front of you, you know that you can walk out on the street and you go right or left or straight ahead. Like you're facing this thing that isn't fully formed and you get to decide how it's going to form and you can make it better. And so my question is like the world's a rough place. There's no doubt about it. It's a harsh place. But my question is what would happen if we stopped making it works how good could it be if we stopped making it worse and I don't know if there's an upper limit to that I get might be maybe we can make it really really really good. Why not and we don't have any better to do than that so I can even have it. Start at home, Even Heaven. Tell the truth. Let's see what the hell happens now like it's tit is the case clearly on the facts of the matter in 20 years. It wouldn't be a single person in the world that was hungry in 20 years. We could get rid of the five biggest diseases that currently played the planet we could straighten things up and God only knows what things could be like that or we can let the whole thing degenerated to help. Showing each of us is making that decision with each decision. That's the other thing that I've understood so Take a choice you want hell you want heaven? Did you pick he'll just remember? You knew what you were doing when you picked a nobody picks. Hell. Yeah, I just sort of let it slide. Yeah, but they do it because they blind themselves, you know, you know when you do it, so well, you know, I let that slide then you and then you don't think about it's like you could think about it. 
========,9,title.
You could think about it you could know but you don't let yourself know is any of this all all the pressure in the Scandal every 3 weeks is this is it away on you? Is it is it difficult? How are you feeling? Like when when I was scarcely anything? Yeah. It's like it's like symbol taneously the worst possible thing in the best possible thing that could happen will financially it's been a boom, right? Yes it switched. Well I say, yes, it doesn't mean the thing that I I shouldn't say this but I'm going to because it's just so goddamn funny. I can't help it say that I figured out how to monetize social justice Warriors That is what it is. Yo, it's so funny. I just can't believe it. Either way. It's just everytime. I think that was just one of The Surreal circumstances that characterize my life. It's like I'm driving to social justice activist in Canada mad because if they let me speak then I get to speak and then more people support me on Patriot. It's like that's a noise like a goddamn capital city of logical Warfare. It's like, okay, let's go protest protest me and then that goes up on YouTube and then my patreon account goes away up. So it's like I don't know what to do when someone who thinks they keep it in his video using me of like hauling in the loop and I think will look here's the situation guys. I give away everything. I do online for free, it's free. The people are giving me money. They're just sending it to me. I'm not twisting their I'm not even asking them for it. Well guess that's not exactly right cuz I set up the patron account but that's more complicated than it looks a lot of that was curiosity start while I could increase the production quality of my online video. So I was also the potential you being removed from the universe are there. Yes, and that was your life and they haven't stopped wanting that end in October when they Lindsay Shepherd Scandal broke and it would look so bad for the left-wing India looks like 200 University of Toronto. A Community member signed a petition to get me fired again and I was kind of upset about that and this is what my life is like it so my son came over that day and I said Jesus Julie and you know, I'd like 200 people at the talk. We met at the University of Toronto petitioned The Faculty Association and then they sent in the petition fee Administration to get me fired with the faculty Association. That's my union. They didn't even contact me Julian said don't worry about it. It was only 200 people and I thought that's what my life is like. It's like a day or two hundred people sign a petition to get me fired as a professor. My son can come in and say well that's not so bad. It's like it's only 200 Pizza near the scales. It's right. It's so it's so surreal because you could say that online and look what's happening in the support would be overwhelming, who knows how many people that Remote key didn't cause any didn't cause a ripple know who it is 200 people and what was their motivation those recordings? How could they possibly be against you based on that? Because they think that the people who who who conducted the Inquisition we're right. Well, that's Madness. Yes, but it look like I mean, I mean this formally like 20 members of pimlott Sandra Buchanan's factly. That was Communications at Wilfrid Laurier wrote a letter supporting them. So that's why it's not an isolated incident. It's like not all they thought that's what they were doing was right, it's Mass hysteria father is an element of doubt. That's for sure. And then after Italy again, I hate to bring this term up again, but this talk to tribalism things. It's like they were there supporting their own and they understand that their own ideologies have been completely connected to the same type of group think that's going against Lindsay Shepherd in that meeting when they tried to paint her as a radical right-wing or and doesn't certainly isn't either you mean the whole thing is ridiculous. You're not. All right, you're not a Neo-Nazi. You're not about to read a lot of crazy things about you and knowing you personally seen this stuff and like this is this is a fascinating time there. That's for sure. That's for sure. Yeah. It's been crazy. Well, I'm what would I say crazy stressful? It's it's the best way to describe it is so real. It's like I stepped outside myself. I can't. I can't put this in a box. I don't know what to make of it. I don't know what to make of the channel 4 interview. You know, it's like what the hell really? It's it's it's crazy. But it's it's this these conversations are so limited by what you were saying before the door trying to get this 5-minute Sound by then. And that's what televisions become it's a dying medium. It doesn't make any sense doesn't make any sense to sandwich these commercials in every 15 minutes or whatever. They do not have it makes any sense. It's an archaic way of communicating ideas to couch a technological way. What like you did, you know, I mean television offers nothing over YouTube nothing. You guys YouTube on my TV space requirements on YouTube. So you don't have to do this twist the complex event into a short sound bite and entertain everyone and it turns out that there's this huge audience online for actual content, but just genuine conversation cuz like one of the things that's happened between you and I went when I come down here. We've actually had a conversation right? We're trying to figure things out on our viewpoints and everything, but we're basically there's a chapter in 12 rules for life called assume that the person you're talking to might know something you don't which is like the formula for a good conversations. Like there's a bunch of things. I don't understand about the world. I mean, that's a big book things. I don't understand about the world and I can come in here and talk to you about what's going on in hopefully, we both emerged with a better understanding. We're not the same people that we were when we walked in and that's a good thing and then we have those Converse. Patience online people can participate in that but I'm trying to do that my lectures to like what I what I did this biblical series. That was another thing that was so strange Joe is like I walked into a venture capitalist organization. I said look, I want you guys to bankroll me. I'm going to do 15 lectures on the Old Testament and I'm going to try to attract young man. I'm going to rent a theater. Like I just laughed me out anything less saleable than that. So what did that went ahead with that? I rented this year and then I walked through the stories and I was learning a lot because like I knew this first stories in Genesis up to the flat. I knew them pretty well. I knew, I understood what they meant. But then all the stories from Abraham on word that I had read them, but I hadn't done in detail in-depth analysis. And so I was learning a tremendous amount walking through those stories and they had a big Ben had a big impact man. 
========,9,title.
And so I'm going to do exit this soon cuz I want to do that but it's just another example of how surreal things have become but also the use the utility of a good conversation because like when I'm up on on on the podium say lecturing, I'm not exactly lecturing. I'm trying to figure something out and sharing that process with the audience just so different than what is going on and universities. That is freaking everybody out and see what what's going on is this indoctrination into this group thing? Write my lectures are more like well, I don't know. What's right like are some things I know and they seem to be working and here's how I use those tools to dig at this store. And here's what it might mean. And this is what I got from it and then hear some Universal truths about human beings seem to be lost. Should we believe this? Should we in the example of an old guy and he's basically lived in his mom's basement. That's that's really the beginning of the story to get to call to Adventure. You know, God says we'll get get get away from your family and you can get out there in the world is the Call to Adventure. Okay fine. That's a motif. What did Abraham goes out in the first thing he encounters is like tyranny and starvation and then a bunch of guys want to steal his wife. so it's it's been entertaining to take those stories apart and to see why their Foundation cuz they are foundation and they're not mirror. Ignorance that what whatever they are ignorant Superstition is not the right category. How is this changed your classrooms? I haven't gone back teaching since all of this hit cuz when did you stop teaching well? How do I guess that's not true? That's not true. I thought I taught from January to May of 2060. 
========,9,title.
Well first wait it changed it was that I was like so so shell-shocked when I went to to teach last January that and I was really sick. Like I've been really sick this year. Last January Cheese's it was just dismal I wouldn't wish that were wish that on my worst. Enemy. I had three weeks where I didn't sleep a wink try that that's really entertaining one long day of misery. That's 3 weeks long what kind of an illness it looks like an autoimmune disorder. Do you think this is because of stress? No, I don't know. Yeah, I think it is probably made it works. But no it's something that I battle with for a long time and it's something that really both my wife and I have autoimmune illness and my daughter got what I don't know exactly what it is. I don't know what it is. How did my daughter dying fast? Yes. That's what's fixed what it was fixed it. That's it. No juice. No, no vegetables. No carbohydrates meat grades, that's it. And then fixed it that seems to have fixed it to get this is so many people. I don't know if you listen to podcasts I've done. Well, I've been following them cuz my daughter has a Blog to call don't eat that and my daughter has Tara terribile autoimmune disorder. It was awful. I detail that out in chapter 12. She had 38 affect the joints and she had her hip and her ankle replacement. She was sixteen. She isn't so she walked around on two broken legs for a year and it's cruciating pain just extremely high doses of opiates. And so she was addicted to opiates would she like she just wants she had her surgery. She just went off then cold turkey and like suffered through the withdrawal for 2 months compared to what she had been through that was nothing like what she went through Matthew it was Dreadful and that was just the surface of it. Like that was only the beginning of her illness. She had all sorts of other things that were worse than that. And so and we figured she was probably going to die by the time She was 30 cuz my cousin's daughter had a similar on immune problem. She died when she was 30. It was Bloody Dreadful, but she figured out at one point that it was associated with diet and then she went on a radically restrictive diet and she Christ cheat she was on anti-depressants. She's not shed take Ritalin to stay awake. She can only stay awake about 6 hours a day and Chad take high doses of Ritalin. Stay awake cheap. What is this an immune disease while she had her diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis, but she didn't have the blood markers for it, but she had all the other symptoms. Anyway, she she figure out this restrictive. She only ate chicken and broccoli for about 2 months and almost all her symptoms went away and she's pretty much symptom-free now and which is complete Miracle. She convinced me to try this diet. What year and a half ago and so I lost 7 pounds a month for 7 months. That was the first thing which was just bloody amazing. Yeah, it was unbelievable was unblocked. I couldn't believe it and you die rich and refined carbohydrates before that rich enough, you know pastas and bread. And so the first thing that happened was I quit snoring that happened immediately took took one week and I was snoring quite badly that so that disappeared in a week and that was amazing. I thought oh that's interesting and that I had gastric reflux disorder that went away and then I lost 7 lb in the first month, I thought that's a lot 7 lb I had psoriasis that went away at floaters in my right eye, which is also not immune problem that went away. I had gum disease for 30 years that went away that went away. That's amazing. I'm 55 like my gum disease went away. It's ridiculous. So I figured all that out my life in last year was so so strange a cuz I get up in the morning and I think got all these bloody scandalous things are happening around me and I have to deal with that and then I think I need a break, but I can't eat anything. Because if I hit the wrong thing it would like knock me out for a month. So I was trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with my diet and I was feeling wretched and so it's like if I would like Wolves at the back door and crocodiles at the front door or something like that, so, but but Whatever like I'm down to the same way. That was when I was twenty-five. Wow. Yeah, no kidding. And I've got lots of energy I wake up in the morning and I wake up that's never happened to me my whole life. I've always had to have a shower took me an hour to wake up my whole life. That's gone. I'm not hungry. I don't have hypoglycemia. I've lost energy nonsense. You can eat. I mean I am on the same. Greens mine. I don't have a disorder like you did in the same regard but I take a day or have a cheat day. Well, I don't even do it every week. We'll have a cheeseburger or something like that. But for the most part that's the guy that I follow as well. Well for some people it seems like from massive amount for far more people than we know. I think the hell are carbohydrate poisoning themselves, like they can't believe yes and along with all the other things that go along with it. Insulin. Cholesterol in this this idea that cholesterol and saturated fat of the problems of people experiencing. It's not true. The real problem is sugar and cholesterol has been demonized and I'm sure you read the article New York Times how the sugar industry paid off scientist to lie about the results in part and parcel of the organization that had produced the food pyramid. They said it was the worst Public Health disaster the last four years pretty much got it backwards like mad crazy. It's crazy. Keyless go to Disney, Disneyland. The reason is that they're they're poisoning themselves with carbohydrates and looks like and the thought process is so out of whack. I retweeted an article today from Nina teicholz. She she tweeted it about this trend of eating only egg whites. How terrible it is 4 it says it's a health disaster and this idea that cholesterol from the egg yolk is bad for it's one of the most important things you can eat. It's an N Weight Watchers is adjusted. Yes. He goes Weight Watchers diet program now adjust their their their protocol and they say that eat all the eggs you want. It is now a zero point food, which is fucking incredible burning fat running like a ketogenic diet. Well, I'm not that was, that would have been complicated enough to keep me occupied the last two years she sorting it out with my daughter because she well that was quite the bloody nightmare. I can tell you it was really something but I can't believe she figured it out. It's amazing. Like she's really pretty damn good shape. She just had a baby like 5 months ago. So that was that's amazing cuz like it was it was rough. Will she sounds like an incredibly cheap example of a tough cookie that girl sounds like it many people are experiencing the same Revelation that they're die discount what I was tired all the time. I doubt it hit an app. I mean, I was always very very active. So I stayed lean because of my physical activity, but by the end of the day, I need an app. I would always take a nap before I go to Jiu-Jitsu. I'm going to have to take a nap. I can't train it was because of carbohydrates. Naps when I'm in the airport or whatever, but that's also you're probably not getting enough sleep. Right. So why did you stop teaching? I took a sabbatical because of all this I told my department chair. I said, look, I had a sabbatical coming up next year. I said look, you know, there's too much going on. It would be better if I take the sabbatical this year, then I can concentrate on my teaching next year. So you take the entire year off Johnson light enable me to concentrate on my research and then for the rest of the time and so technically I'll be going back teaching in January of 2019 technically.

Technically. I can't think of your head at the moment. I don't know what the hell's going the same way because At some point the technological transformation means you have to approach things differently. And so now if I do a lecture online would have the lecture happens to be I can get a hundred and fifty thousand people who watch it. That's minimum. So the first question would be what why would I teach 300 people when I could teach a hundred fifty thousand that's just stupid to do that those same three also have access to the Huntington. That's right. That's exactly and the next thing is well. I taped my maps of meaning class and my personality class for three years running so it's there, but I can do it again, but why taped I would rather lecture about new things. So that's what I did this year. I did this biblical series, which I have done before but now if I'm going to lecture again, I'm going to lecture about different things because Because the technology has transformed the landscape. We're not in 1990 anymore not even a little bit. So this is something I want Weinstein not steam I make that mistake often. Sorry Brett, but it is the same thing brilliant guy restricted by his university big Scandal you have leaves and I'm hoping he falls the same path cuz he has so much to offer and he has so much to offer for anybody who can get online. What are the things? That's really fun About You Tube then and having my lectures on YouTube is that the only reason people watch them is one reason is cuz they want to learn that's it. You might think well, where is the University? Well, the university is where people want to learn right side. Okay. Well YouTube is the University because there's hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube maybe Millions who just want to learn like fine. I'm an educator. I'll talk to people who want to learn because if your educated that's what you do is that most effectively done in the University's not self-evidently. So now I'm trying to figure this out, you know, like I like my job at the University U of T has treated me well apart from this Scandal thing, but they were kind of taken aback by they didn't know what to do about that.

You know, it was a new law and when I made the video criticizing Bill c16 I said, I think that making this video is probably illegal in and of itself was their controversial moments in your career before that. No. Wow. No, I mean it surprised me because I've always I would say that but the content of my lectures is being atypical but it's been atypical in a good way like the student response to my lectures is always being extremely good extremely good. I'm always surprised that I was able to teach what I'm teaching because I always thought that it was insanely revolutionary, but it was revolutionary in a really like in a scholarly way. No one like I'm a careful scientist. I'm a careful thinker I think things all the way through to the bottom and I'm really self-critical like what I wrote maps of meaning which was my first book I suspect I rewrote every sentence at least 15 times. It's probably more than that and I really literally mean rewrite it. So I take the sentence out of the paragraph put it in another document right like 10 variants of the sentence and then pick the one that was best and I did that. I took me 15 years to write I did that over and over and over and so what I was write a sentence and then I think okay. Am I got all the words right? Every single word is that the proper words the proper phrase is the proper sentence do I believe that this sentence is true that I think like 10 ways I could attack it and see if I could break it apart and find out what it was wrong. And I only kept the ones that I couldn't destroy and like I was going out. To destroy them because I wanted to come up with a no, I wanted to produce a book that I could not break no matter what I did and so I spent 15 years on that and then that was the basis. What's the basis for 12 rules for life. It's being the basis for all the lectures I've done and so forth and like I can't see where it's wrong. And mostly what I was trying to do is to see where it was wrong and I can't get underneath that. I can't break it. That's what's so fascinating to me about all this stuff and not to Not to overly exaggerated the significance of this but just to be completely honest about it. You're the right guy for the job and it's sort of found you it's real weird cuz there's not a lot of people that have that meticulous about their thoughts in about their work in about their writing about their criticizing their own ideas to the point where they break them down. Try to break them try to tear him apart problem. So when I when I started to write maps of meaning I thought okay, what's the situation? This is the Cold War we've divided into two arm tribal caps, and we've decided that Settling the difference between us is worth risking being itself. We could we could drive everything into Extinction. We're willing to take that chance. What the hell is going on? So I wanted to know two things what was truly driving the tribalism of the Cold War including its including the generation of that fast nuclear Arsenal is that just seemed to me to be in sanity taken to the final Pinnacle. So I wanted to know that and I wanted to know okay having figured out why that's happening what could be done about it. So it would stop and at the same time I was also studying but it happened in Washington with the Nazis all of that. And so it was a very serious problem and I actually wanted to have the answer actually wanted to answer. I didn't want to write an interesting book about it wasn't even that I wanted to write a book exactly. It was just at writing a book was the best way to figure out the problem because it's Ray writing a book is so rare. Racino Casino you think but you can only remember so much you have to write it down. Then you can remember way more you can write and then the next day you can go back and take okay. I'm going to take that goddamn argument apart and see if there's anything about it this week. And so and I think I did figure it out. I think I didn't figure it out. So and then when I went well then I started lecturing about it and lectures role is unbelievably well-regarded like people all the kids in the classes would always write for the evaluations at the end of the year 80% of them would say in this happen for 20 years to say this class changed everything about the way I look at the world like yeah, that's what happened to me too. And I wrote that book. It's like I didn't think the same way at all when I was done. I started to understand what these ancient stories meant.
