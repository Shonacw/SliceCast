That's what I do math my life. That's my life is pretty crazy though. I mean how much time did you have when you got here? I got here about an hour early some pictures next time next time. I'll catch you after the show. You are a guy that for a lot of people you sort of embody the idea of hardening your mind and figuring out a way to do things that most people think are impossible. That's you sort of become that guy over your life and you become that guy for a lot of people including me online. We talked about you on the podcast a ton of times. So having you in here is been very excited to me. I appreciate that. Thank you. How do you become that guy? You know what I grew up. Not that guy. Yeah. So a lot of people put a title on me. They want to They See Me Now They See Me Now is the guy that with the short off we can do 4030 pull-ups and 17 hours to get my chores and 5 miles and 39 hours. We do all this crazy shit, but what I don't understand is they don't understand the journey that it took me to get to this point and what got me to his point was I was just the opposite of rain today. I was that guy who ran away from absolutely everything that got in front of me, but not many people knew that I had two people at the like the real me was like this very scared insecure stuttering got beat up by his dad was kind of stuff. I built this fake person that walked around like my shit in the stink, you know, you know how I did it and process Time I realize that I was lying to myself a lot of people because it's a fascinating Journey though because you are that guy now running you genuinely are legit badass or at one point time. You were a legit terrified person. Yes. So what was the process? Like? How did you how did you step four? Well, it's it's it's a long process right? My dad beat the shit on me was growing up. I was the first black baby born in this hospital called Millard Fillmore in Buffalo, New York. My dad on skating rinks. You don't bars here and prostitutes from Canada to Buffalo New York. My dad was a big-time pimp big-time anything bad about a person they time Hustler. He was American not that. Movie time Denzel Washington he was at but not that bad though. He wasn't that big but that's what it reminds me of he was that kind of guy and beat the shit out of me. Does she help you out of my mom? There was an incident more time on my mom got knocked out top of the stairs and Drug down the stairs by her hair and I 6 years old on their forget this In my mind, I was always afraid my whole life. I was afraid by this fucking voice this this conscience. That would always be battling me say hey, you got to get up and do something. I didn't want to do shit. I was just afraid but I would that that boys would force me to get up and my dad and I try to beat him up whenever at 6 and I get my ass kicked so it went on for several years and have a big time learning disability. Can my dad and I Believe in Us going to school. So my dad is about to business the skating rink in the bar. So the skating rink open by 7 at night and this is time. I was able to walk to about 5 No 4 5 6 years old 8 9 and I'll go to snow skating rink 7 at night and I work the skating rink until 10 at night and then we would scrape the gum off the floors and we clean the whole skating rink up and then my dad in the office and my brother and myself asleep in the office and I'm Mama go upstairs and work the bar until 3 in the morning then they clean the bar up. So That's all that she was done with going to school really happened. So when I went to school, I was all kind of my Lord disability. I had social anxiety. I was just a jacked up kid from living in this tortured home from the outside looking in was in the all-white neighborhood and then we would travel to the Ghetto of Buffalo New York with the skating rink is at so, you know, we worked around mostly blacks and I live by mostly whites. But no one knew what was going on that house at on 201 Paradise Road is crazy, but my mom got courage to finally leave him when I was 8 years old. We moved to a small town in Brazil, Indiana. And that's when the real war started for me and was only has a small town great people a lot of great people and I say that because why do we get offended and I'm going to get the point where to get offended there was about maybe 10 black families at about ten thousand people in town. And in 1995 the KKK, March 4th, July parade. So this was a lot of races in their show me being one of the few black kidnapping on the area. You know, it could come haunt you I had stuff on my notebook neoniger going to kill you and my Spanish notebook. They have it on my car and they were going to kill this is really nice. And so, you know, I showed it didn't hurt me. It was jacking me up. So all the insecurities I have him as a kid with my father. I'm moving to this area here and it just got worse and worse and worse and it's haunted me and that voice that talked about it kept talkin louder and louder and louder. Do nothing about it and I decide to make moves and I cheated all through school and it's it's kind of humbling to talk of my stories sometimes and it's it's all so embarrassing but it's real is who the fuck is emesis.

Volume is this is what created me and Poppy from the fourth grade to the two to my junior year in high school on every assignment and I want to get in the military want to join the Airforce in the guy gave me an ASVAB test is like a water down the SAT and I couldn't copy on it because the Gabbie Show me how to test ATI test be together Mariah Tennessee jobs with the copy on this technically a copy on so I got to get when I want to be a Air Force pararescue man. It's got to jump out of airplanes and Savion Pilots. It's a it's a special operator in the Air Force and my score was so horribly low that if we take it again and he said hey, I got the 18 the second time. He even worse. I need to get a 50 out of a 99 and so my mom and I for a while we live in the government subsidized apartments $7 a month and also food stamps and we slowly moved up to him $230 month place that the time y'all are pretty poor, but The mama Ford enough money for me to go to see a tutor 1 1 hour a week. So for 4 hours a month at 6 months to study for my last test. I want to take the address to know the answer to test three times and I study my ass off and passed it. I got in the Air Force realize it was more things in front of me. I was afraid of water purify the water and I don't know how to swim but we get everybody in this training and all special ops training is the water confidence. Will they try to pretty much drowns your ass, you know, all of our Lives we've been breathing and they take that from you if you want to see how comfortable you are on the water is like 1% African Americans in Special Operations, and I didn't know anything about African to be like a lot more negative point which I am because the bone density I struggled but I'm 6 weeks in the program. There's about twenty five guys left have about 150. I was there and I was asleep for six weeks to program. And I want to quit so badly, but I quit everything in my life. I copy through school. I want to prove people wrong. And so here I am in this Air Force program trying to get a little more confidence. But this one was kicking my ass in 6 weeks in the program. The doctor gave me a blood test. It was at sickle-cell sickle-cell trait not the anemia, but I still kill people but so he pulled me out training for a week and when you go from being very uncomfortable in that water situation, and then now you're comfortable. I'm sitting back watching the guys drown. I'm not I'm not part of the activities anymore for this week. I want to get back in that damn water again. So the fear overcame and all my insecurities to my dad from this small town from everything so I can be back and even though no one knew how fucked up I was Scottrade. This other person was tough. I live with this should all time so may not want to go back in that water the doctor. Call me back up. I thought you get like a like a medical kicked out of military. So no quitting for me to take me out so I can have some pride the doctor said no milk. Hit me up and put you back in the training and I was like fuck but after a week I'm like, you know what I missed one week. There's only three weeks left is a good chance, you know, I could chuck this shit out and go on but went back to the CEO and the commanding officer of the program and the sergeant said, hey you guys start from day one because you missed you know that we could train him and I broke I'm broke. I couldn't imagine going back through that again. So I made up a lie, and I said man is sickle-cell things really scaring me. It was a fucking War. When sickle-cell I pretty much quit even though they gave me a medical equipment. So we from the age of 19 age of twenty-two. I went to the Job Corps tacp where you control fast movers Behind Enemy Lines cool job, but there's no water. I was afraid the water. So I avoid it and I gained 125 lb in that time frame from 175 to almost 300 to 297 the heaviest that start at finding things that was comfortable and the more things I found comfortable the more uncomfortable. My mind was cuz that voice I'll tell you about it. You always was there. I was just trying to avoid that conscience. I want to be left alone from that conscious and it wouldn't leave me alone. So I got out the Air Force and I start working for Job Corps Ecolab Ray spray for cockroaches at 24 and spraying at different Steak and Shakes Red Lobster, whatever from 11 at night to 7 in the morning. And what changed I came home and watch the Discovery Channel show class 224. I came home from Steak and Shake. I spray it down last get a big old large 42-ounce Shake while cross the street and get a box of mini Donuts from 7-Eleven. Now, I drive home for 45 minutes to take old fat guy. Who yeah, I worked out but I was fat I didn't run did it PT hit the gym. So while I'm driving home to the TV on and what comes on Discovery Channel showing that's why everything changed for me. I was taking a shower. I walked out her these guys and I watch the show and it made me reflect big-time on the piece of shit that I am and I'm exactly what people say. I was going to be So what was on the show that really struck home? It was I saw these guys going in the water. So I was terrified of it and I can't even express. Have you had a big fear and I know a lot of Fighters have stuff like that, but they get over them, but I'll always have these fears that you just don't want to fucking face and I have a lot of them had a lot of them and that's what created the person isn't funny today and we'll get into that. But I'm just scared bitch is what I was and but I want these guys going through hell week class 224 and these guys are ringing the bell quitting dropping the helmet down rolling out. A lot of guys just leaving and it made me reflect on my fears May the Securities and I saw a real men when I thought were real man who are staying for overcoming adversity who are overcoming all these different things that I had blame so many fucking people in my life for my dad about my mom for not being there when I was 14 years old. My momma said get remarried to the straight guy. He got murdered and then I move back to a small town in Brazil then and I thought everybody was applying not my Lord disability my my skin color, you know, maybe being everything and so why am I sat there for a while and I was like man, I got a fucking I've got it. No one's going to fucking come and help me. No one's going to fucking come. He's just fucking me against me. And I'm so I had to man up and ask him for the guy start doing a space in every fucking fear. I have not what the fuck it is man in these things will keep me up at 9:01 people who were here in this shit. They they will never really understand and grasp when You Face these things are so many things how they keep you up and haunt you at night and has a lot of people out there that know what you're talkin about. I mean and now I'm so that's what I did my two options either. Be that 300-pound guy who sprayed for cockroaches and made $1,000 a month and at 24 years old knowing when I'm fifty fucking years old. I can reflect on this and think about what God never became or I can totally just suck it up and fail and fail and fail and tie succeed. So I started call recruiters up. My son will be a fucking Navy SEAL and every crew. So there's a weight and height. This is so the weight and height limit to get in the military and I was six foot 1 + 297 and I have prior service which was a big deal. So I called all his recruiters up in the office today. How tall are you the little boy that got into conversation to see if he's even qualified and by the time I got my wait don't hang up pretty much like a you-know-what call somebody else and I'll try to get in the reserves try to get the reserves. Carlos got in Stevenson Al Jarreau recruiter out. They said I'd come on in. He saw me coming to the weight standard all this other stuff and To get into the class. I had to get into how to lose a hundred and six pounds in less than three months.

So I was like the fact that I can't do that grab my chocolate milkshake and went back to Ecolab. I'm going back to work man. This is my life. So in this job you looking looking for cockroaches looking for Road and stuff like that and this next morning or his next night. I went to work and I hit the ground like cockroaches too much. I hit the motherload of cockroaches and this restaurant. Full of cock roaches and rodents and everything else that I sat there and said, this is my life as an additional like you are exactly who the fuck did this is it And I said this ain't going to be it for me. So in that restaurant, I quit my job left my canister that restaurant my my spray canister got back in my Ecolab truck and I went home and I started working out like somebody I was. Became the most obsessed person on the planet Earth. That was basically Add event a guy that didn't exist. I didn't been a guy that can take any pain. He suffered any kind of judgment be called Niger because whatever the fuck in the world and be last and the buckaroos say go fuckyourself how to build the item build this callous mine and I built it through suffering. I posted to downright fucking just crushing myself if it was raining outside three or more if it was snowing the first instinct is don't go out there and do shit my intake was we got a fucking go out there anything that was fucking horrible in my life that I normally say? No that was inhumane the most people I had to go do it and I start at Calais in my mind at this point in my life and I lost the weight. I lost the weight and I went back to recruit. I got into that class. And I went through three Navy. So help me some one year only God ever be in three whole weeks in one year up to my knowledge the first night at make it through the next two I did and I didn't stop anymore from there and I started realizing to this through this process. That the fucking mind is what you created and I started open a different doors. I didn't think we're even there didn't think even existed in the more doors open up the more I start realizing that my potential is Danny Ramos in it change my whole mindset somewhere from David Goggins not created Goggins. And that journey is a Priceless Journey that it's hard for me to explain to people cuz it sounds so quick and easy that guys want this way and I went through three hoagie sandwich Ranger school with the Delta Force selection.

Whatever it is, it was brutal. It's a brutal Journey every fucking day if ever you happy. If anybody knows my life story, I'll try to give you a hug just a snippet of it where I'm at. The Days Inn front of Joe Rogan telling you my life to get through where I became to get through rum at now is nothing but Pride a half of myself that I can't really I can't leave so people can I have the space under space that they see that are you happy? What's wrong with you? I'm driven. I'm obsessed and I did you see people need to hear the story. This is a this is an exciting story for people because there's a lot of people out there that feel trapped and it feels stuck and they feel like they can't do anything at this is who they are your guy who felt that exact same way but figured out how to not be that person and be a person you would admire. How did you what were the first steps like you had some slips before ripe cuz you you quit because of the water thing right? But then when you went back the second time you decided not to lose all that weight you quit that job. Did digit was it just straightforward from there or where there's some days will you just failed and then you picked it back up again. So my first run that aside to lose the weight. I was like I said 297 soir 32% body fat and I whip my idea was to run for my for my first run. I didn't know how bad is going to fucking hurt me. I used to run before I was fat and I was like fucking I can do this. I ran the quarter-mile walked on iWatch on the side of my couch and cry with your mom's house. He was about 14 about maybe 20 minutes down the road and try to get in her car. So now I can't fucking do wish I don't know when we do. I just got somebody pregnant. My life was as fuck. 
========,9,title.
I make $1,000 a month. My rent was 8:10 a month and my mind is just fucking with me. I can fuck. You're not good enough man. This isn't for you. And these guys the best my first time playing with you. Not that and I What it was kind of funny I was obsessed with Rocky. Rocky one in particular and when I was a kid I come every day and I watch this fucking show Rocky and I would fast forward with the little VHS tapes to round 14 Round 14. Fuck me up like nobody's business why the song came on my truck when I bought the pull up record. I listen to the song for 17 hours is 2 minutes and 13 seconds. And I'm able to visualize and dream. Like nobody's business and I know that I can create a vision that many people can't and I work for it. So the vision I had was when Apollo Creed beat the fucking shit out of Rocky beat the shit out of this kept fighting. He was a dumb fighter couldn't read couldn't fuck love me or you could write just Punchy everything about him and Rocky beat Apollo Beach, is that corned here by way of saying stay the fuck down and him getting up him beating up a poetry raise his arms up in a fucking her turn around by you want to fight he turns around and sees this guy getting up and it was the face of Apollo Creed that changed my life. The face of Apollo Creed it was like just burn that mother fucker getting up that waiting just for him getting the fuk up a Pokemon lose his Champions best rock you taking his soul. I literally taking his soul his head goes down. He looks like what the fuck are you I wanted to be that not Rocky. I want to be the guy that people looked at I'll give you like me or Dan like I don't care but it said this motherfukers and they keep coming after whatever the fuck is in front of them. I wanted that I wanted that I wanted that worse than anything in the world. So that is I kept picturing me falling down and getting up and every mother fucking to call me Niger. I was dumped even myself either myself. I wanted to feel something besides to feet. I wanted to just go to distance and not going to distance push me to a point of where now go way past the distance. So you go the first day you will you run a quarter-mile that you walk back home and you're upset. How do you how do you move forward? So basically I did when I came home and I had a chocolate milkshake. I sat down I gave up. I said a single fucking happy McCaulou's 106 pound. I can go 1/4 fucking mop. I started being able to take negative shit and be happy and this whole I say what if a lot it sounds corny and it sounds weak, but it's true. What are the recruiters said there's not many black Navy Seals my back. I was a 36 African-American seal in history. Is it over several years? Because the fucking water you know, how many people get mad at his fucking true just get over it and so Awesome app. What story would it be if I fucking fat dumb? Lying to be friends with people insecure ass can overcome this shit and that would if mentality that that that that dreamer mentality just we always do with me if you shoot man. 
========,9,title.
What if I can be what if I can be a single man, what would if I can go from there in the corner and fucking mom and I are about 25 miles can go in and how would it feel if I'm graduating kind of get at the graduation thing. I'm talking about 2:24 that I like the video. I sent down watch just ran off just stood up and he said to the graduation. I've got your graduating butts like 18 of them. He said we live in a society where mediocrities often rewarded that you went on to say something about these men detest mediocrity. And I want to be a man that the test mediocrity it all it got me a lot of trouble in the SEAL Teams and going forward my life because I just started looking down on people for not going hard fucking shit and I started to create different things but I ask for a different day, but I just believe it at my home and changed that is a problem that a lot of people who work hard to have you get angry people who don't work hard to the point where you you know, you won't insult them. You want to you want to smack them and it's really cuz you scared of seeing that yourself. Yeah. I probably truth. That's probably not. So I guess a lot of time I thought I would see people in a part was a direct reflection of who I was and I will get mad at them were in Reflections probably has to get mad at myself here. That's for me a hundred percent when I when I see people there have a thousand things I get terrified of seeing that myself and I get mad at them, right and it's it's not a good way to handle it. You know, but it's it's natural cuz you're Pterophyta seen that trait right and it cost me so you come back you do the quarter mile, right? You walk back home. How do you regroup? So what I did I sat down and I put Rocky in. I got my milkshake prog-rock EIC know what I was big time in Rocky in a platoon why platoon, I love to see people who were getting beat down and if there's the scenes there seems that this drove me and people are my hell wasting our house and three of them, they always hear me sing any songs the songs how many songs and torturous situations when you're with everybody is quitting this fucking Cole. I would be somewhere gone somewhere fucking gone. If somewhere fucking darkish it there's a scene up at 2 when Elias Ben Barnes shoots Elias and you know, they think he lies his dad and the Choppers are taken off and Charlie Sheen's ask him, you know, Tom Berenger Elias Elias William Dafoe actor dead somewhere. And through the woods the Vietcong is chasing Lions to the woods and shooting his fucking back. And all he wants to do is get to the fucking Chopper is getting shot. His back is getting up getting shot in face getting up and you see this guy despite. I love the fucking guy who just fucking fights. And so I put these things in those reminders that you're going to have to fucking suffer man this fucking .25 medicine man. You're going to have to fucking suffer her to go from this fat insecure motherfuker to one of the best guys on the planet Earth. This journey is going to take something that is going to be incomprehensible most people and these different visualisations how I visualize them in myself talk if he came so nasty and dirty that I wasn't liked the fact that went .25. So if you came from being defeated to like man, I'm a motherfuking maybe and maybe more than 0.75. You know, it just became this different mind so I turned Gets into positives so I would I would take like who who would even think about doing it. So I was sitting like outside who at 297 who can't fucking swim that great Prestige are the fucking water. We have to fucking ball pit balls to fucking man up quit a job and go and it put everything on himself. So it's how I start talking to myself and put myself in a whole different category. That was to me the next day and I just kept using that as fuel in fuel. No one would do this shit don't want to do this shit YouTube bad motherfuker around your Batman Forever live and I had with the right kind of message that I needed to hear that was never telling myself if Through Time. 
========,9,title.
It became reality to myself. So you start out on the first day and then it would do start running again the second day. Yes, I can have it right back at it again. But after I realized I can't go that far, right? So what I did was I became damn near professional cyclist with the miles I put on the bike. So I never never watch TV. I had to be doing something. So I was riding the bike. I rode a bike a lot to it. Take to lose the first initial kind of way cuz it took my bones were just hurting so bad. My body is broken now going to get on that also and I try to swim a lot. I want a great summer but putting things are going to equalize my body. I went from negative point. So I start feeling a whole bunch that spent hours in the pool hours in the pool trying to get more and more comfortable not because I was going to underwater. I was so scared of water that I had to live in the water and to become one with the water. So going to the pool used to scare me. So I went to the pool awful awful lot and then the bike got easier I was able to run more I went for my 1-mile run my was a great accomplishment to my house and then from 2 to 3 was a bigger than I went from 3 to 6. And then like they've a warning order that they give you to get ready for Buds and whole thing was running 6 miles 5 days a week and that was my goal is so I just kept I failed a go back to scratch our use some positive motivation had like one day by like fucking defeated but I thought it was a part of the process. This is probably join. I realize this is part of my process was just saying like I used to with that good enough if I'm not good enough. We always say that shit. That's not good enough to let me try something else. I'm going to fucking make myself good enough and that became my mentality. I'm going to make myself good enough and so I misunderstood a lot, but that's that's all that came down to I made myself good enough and the days. Run that far the next week, I would do two-a-days so I can on the running if I ran a quarter-mile. I wait a couple hours it haunt me bother me. I try to run a half mile next time same day. You can do more than this if I had to walk out walk. It just became just a process of grinding and grinding and grinding a good word for it. Is that even a good word for Dad just just going further and further and then when I got through running I go to the bike I go to the pool. If I got tiresome where my legs are tired I go to the gym and I developed this crazy work out what I was doing volume like to 300 reps of like very lightweight people say how you how come you have any like Nu Skin my workout routine the gym became sick it became sick. I was just doing to 300 rf400 wraps on my chest just like for one simple exercise the best press. And a racket get back on it. Just wrap it out trying to brush me to Kara's. I can't build that muscle mass and I just became just became obsessed with it. So when you doing this, so you worried at all about repetitive stress injuries, or the fact that your body is not condition for this and you you're basically taking your body where you would have used it right? 
========,9,title.
And now you're you're forcing it to live like an elite athlete right? I didn't care. I didn't know any better I think about it while I did. I I didn't know that working out that Harbor fuck you up. I just did it. Fuck you up. That's one reason. I'm with you three whole weeks. So We'll talk about a lot but the stress in my life getting to 24 caused me have some serious. So as issues, I know anything about this shit the psoas muscle is what we use that your hip flexor muscle and basically under stress. It starts to tighten up and I wish I started for the time I was in third grade at time. I was in seventh grade white blotches on my skin. I was just I was in that case it's all the insides of me are also getting fucked up to on this process my psoas muscle get real tight to my T 12. I can show you the bump on the back of my head after the show's over but I had to try to go in this fucking like large tumor looking bump in the back of my head from my body compressors. I'm 6ft. Well, but my muscles are like five foot nine because I just started just the muscle tightness for my sore ass going to my T 12 hours. Just getting tighter my quads everything get tired from distress distress in my life. So the more I stretch my body with the word My lower body to came out of balance. So I had a bunch of stress fractures bunch of injuries going to Buds and how I got through buds was they getting my third time was my last time going through hell week. I facing put a black sock on at 4 in the morning and I will get duct tape to had numerous dress fraction of both my legs because my car my body was literally like coming in on itself in my legs are like I was I was pruning it really bad and putting stress on my stress on my shins. And so I will put duct tape or duct tape my feet and I will show you the top of them where I have pressure ulcers are the size of quarters from you know, how the ankle joint so the foot goes to the shin and how you move this with a taper so tight it just created a nice ulcer right there. And I just I just kept going through it. So you just use that tape to support your ankles rights are basic cast myself after the first 30 45 minutes. The pain was excruciating but then it would go now and I would go down and then that's how I got through. Wow. Did I do any long-term damage? I've been out for five years. So I retire for another Twenty One years in military the time in the Air Force and I did. 16 years in the Navy told you 43 Jessica 30. That's good. That's good. You really you look very young for your age whenever I'm stressed I get after it. I fix whatever's bothering me. So I basically the last five years everything. I've done in my life. I did it being very unhealthy. I've never talked about it. I just kept going and it cost me pretty much. I was choking my insides out adrenal issues signs of adrenal issues. Thyroid issues anything with endocrine system Prima shut down on me organs were shutting down and I went from a guy who could run 205 miles to go looking out bed and the doctors are trying to search what was wrong. That's why I figure out the so as muscle no one figured it out and I hit it by accident. So I've missed two days of stretching out. Five years and so would happen with all the shit. I did to myself the stress. I was under physical mental all kind of ship. It is choke me out from the inside and doctors put me all kind of medication in the medications are doing the exact opposite. We're just going to show her. I was on DHEA. I was on some different things to for my estrogen different things for my alarm. I was on anything to do with your with your endocrine system. Thyroid medicine good God. I was on cortisol all kind of shit to get my stuff. I'd like to rub in my throat and like a heart was always I couldn't run down the street. My body was just jacked up couldn't sleep. I hope I was just down shut down. I could give you a lot more than that. At least give me the app I was fucking dying and so I couldn't do anything with a guy who was this guy to guy who can't do shit and act like I don't know what's wrong with your labs are this is it PTSD? Is it what's what's going on? I knew what I knew that shit. So I sat in the bed one day and I realized man my life is over. This is it but it gave me time to reflect on everything. I need complish God never take time to reflect on the kid. I was too man. I am now. So honest this time I wasn't working out and what's the best time of my life cuz I got a chance to really reflect back and be proud of who I became I never took time to do that.

It was like one after another get the fuck after get after get after you ain't good enough my fucking after I get after it and I got haunted show me way. This process went on for a while more medication isn't working. It's not working. No doctor can figure it out. I'm like fuk it. I saw this doc about eight years before this happened because I came and you're so fucking tight. I never seen anybody in my life as tight as you you need 50000 hours of stress these two awesome crazy number. I would ever stretch and you know, it stretched res bad for you. So it sucks I worked out so hard I have time to stretch and I was running 15 miles a week back into work. Now as I was getting after Matt. I was working a full-time job and stretching and doing that to my body was literally getting Tighter and Tighter not just from what I was doing, but they don't cuz you ran this now wouldn't that man and I'm going to try to stretch out so I don't do anything for like 10 minutes or know, how do you know 6 me to add bulshit? So I start stretching out one hour hour-and-a-half long story short, man. I shave my head once every morning and that bump on the back of my fucking head after I realized it was shrinking for some fucking reason. I don't know why cuz I shave my head back and I was like this getting smaller. Troy the bump got healthier I got going on in the best shape my damn life right now from stretching out while I was all it was away from like I came in counter medications. I was on now. I'm on a very low-dose thyroid pill. Do you ever do yoga all the time and all the time and I might if I were to kill somebody one thing right now man. That's so as muscle and getting that hip flexor open up cuz Ross Dress the fuck out it was so much worse than others that changed my life. Yeah. How do you say Nick Gregorius? How do you say his last name? The Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt from England Greek fellow he has a great quote about yoga. He said yoga is a martial art you do against yourself to great way of putting it was your percent what it feels like when you're in there, right? And so you how many years ago was this was five years ago. I would have to go in and how long was there. Where you couldn't work out at all there is about always try to do something but I couldn't run Harley though. I can run maybe half a mile and all that heart she would happen if I hardly get a fib not all kind of stuff happened and I started this stretchy. And also I tried to pull ups every now and then but everything was just didn't have the energy. I didn't have anything at me. Nothing was processing right for me to think that you just broke in your body cause you pushed it too hard. And how's your percent? I I sat back in that bed that night and I had a lot of time to reflect and see how it was actually kind of proud of myself and I'm very sick twisted way. I even though people understand it I had to do what I had to do. And you know and I did it like I didn't tell you how I got into ultra-running, you know, there's a lot of things that so I pushed it extremely hard. I went Way Beyond what I thought was capable like my first Ultra race I did I was I was heavier.

I was in Iraq your the Marcus Luttrell Lone Survivor. I was in buds. I was in three whole weeks as you knows I said many times I do a lot of guys that down the operation now is at freefall school with Morgan the trail who is his twin brother during the operation Red Wings box chosen Survivor on New Market Road. Well, and I was about 200 some-odd pounds and I didn't run hold it all this time. I was a seal sounds like a bodybuilder and I did it elliptical trainer 20 minutes on Sunday all I did so I did I walk that car yesterday. I was never about it until this happened. So that happened I was at man. I got to find a way to raise money. Freddy's family. So I Googled it. I found a foundation Special Operations Warrior Foundation that Google the 10 hardest races in the world. I do nothing about what you write the first ever run 20 miles at one time. And what channel does the badwater 135 her a 35 mile run through Death Valley in the summer time. I thought was a fucking stage race. I know people can run a hundred 35 miles at one time had no idea you were partying stage race. Will you run like 20 miles out and then run 20 more to get her 35 miles Chris Kaufman of the badwater. He said are you Ultra Runner? And I was like, I don't know what that is. You guys. Have you been a hundred miles and 24 hours or less? Cuz I know I said, I'm a Navy SEAL. I was in three whole weeks. I was arranged I gave him some resume. He didn't give a shit. He said I don't care you got qualify for my race. And the deadline was up in two months this badwater race and basic. 
========,9,title.
He said there's two more races you can do to qualify and I might consider you my Raceway slicktop 90 a piece in the world in you have an ultra-runner but I like your calls like what you doing. He said come up on a Wednesday and he has a race on Saturday in San Diego San Diego one day when you run around a 1-mile track for 24 hours to me. Imagine get to get a hundred twenty-four hours. I will consider it my race. I did the math 14 Summit mile fuk it I can do that. Dumb shit, they cannot say that right now. It was rough first man. I've been in my chore Libras is race. So I have my wife the time. She know my ex-wife we go to Walmart get a blue launch are Ritz crackers in my Flex that's only half for a hundred mile run. So show up at the start line is race. It was a UA national championships. It's like the best Ultra Runners compete against each other too. Skinny Majin get 24 hours and I'm just big bodybuilder looking guy. I have to shut you up then at least it made them more and jacked up the fuck up bitch ass out there. I was I was jacked up. Here's a picture of me. You definitely didn't look like someone to run a hundred miles not at all. So basically I start running and I get to about my 40-mile 50 and I'm feeling pretty good. I get to my 70 and It was the worst pain in my life. I sat down this blue lawn chair model 70 and my the Ritz crackers after mile 22. Can Ritz cracker balls? I wouldn't hide your crappy. I know what to do while drinking myoplex for my nutrition. I couldn't eat these Ritz crackers have very minimal water if any at all and I was dying so I sat down with blue lawn chair as I was watching last Winter's go around the circle. That was all dizzy and lightheaded haven't gone to the bathroom. It's been about twelve hours. I'm at 70 miles my 12 hours, which is good and looked at my ex-wife now and I was like, I am shocked that don't seem like three of her and wants my body stopped. My mind just went off and had to go to the bathroom and the bathroom is like is like 20 feet away from me if that the current as I sat there and pee blood down my leg and cramping up my back and with 30 miles to go I am my feet were broken. I was just in the were shaking when she stopped running. Not running like that. Amy had it running almost a year. I was just doing bodybuilding stuff and 20 minutes of elliptical trainer. No running at all. I probably ran no shit. No shit no more than 50 miles to whole year. That wasn't my thing. I wanted to be like Jack and I didn't want to be cardio guy. I want to be ripped big Navy SEAL guy and In the day before this race is funny. Just got him Joe Burns. You put me through my whole weeks still guys were the hardest guys out there. He was in the gym the Friday before I do this race and he was doing a full body squats deadlifts power cleans to do this race approved signed off on it. So I'm going to gym I went in there the full body hardcore squat deadlift in everything with this guy because I knew he was going to come watch me in this race. So I've always been about how man you going to see me come in here and check this way in the mall you watch me do a hundred mile run. What do you think about that? So basically I paid for it. So it might so you came out there with my favorite thing chocolate mini Donuts cuz you knew my story of my past life and but sick mini Donuts out there and I'll have my hat pulled down and that model 70 made it was torturous and my blood down my leg and 30 miles to go. Start a reason a cookie jars Man by pulling off all kind of stuff. I reached in my mind and a lot of us, but we have bad times in life. Even the hardest person where we forget how badass we are during a hard time. I have a thing right take a couple seconds to reflect on Iron Man. You been to come to this been through that you overcame it overcame that I don't ever close my mind to the fact that this can be done and I knew how to get up. I need nutrition. I need to hide race. I need to get stop being dizzy. So that's the first thing I did I didn't panic when I have 30 more miles to go to get a hundred. I start the process slowly but surely he's able to stand up and I was literally hobbling around his truck was just walking no running at all. 
========,9,title.
I couldn't run my feet work in the worst pain is the worst pain. I've been in my tire like nothing in any training is even a comparable to this last 30 miles. What happened was? My ex-wife looked at me and she's like man. We need a green. I'm about to make the time I was going way too slow and at that time that my 81 Something clicked down never probably have to do it again. When My Mind Body Spirit Soul. Everything is connected in my mind knew I wasn't fucking around anymore and knew it wasn't going to quit and knew that guy was dead and buried and gone and I was going to die out here on this fucking Walmart for for whatever reason why I was going to get through this motherfucker. I don't give a damn it made trophy at the end. I want even in a race in my mind. There was a it was nothing you want about nothing. There was no nothing was there a bunch of people didn't know what the fuck I was ever made against me, and I used all these different Dark Places to start bringing out light and just fucking going deeper and deeper and it burned the next 20 miles around a hundred miles and I ran the next 20 miles ran at about 10:30 pace and I did 101 miles in 18 hours and 56 minutes. Sat back down. Blue porta potty now my chair that got from Walmart and that's when the body realize I was done and this great feeling came over me, but also the worst pain in my life. That's what I took a humongous shit on myself as literally like I like a fucking log up my fucking back piss so much blood diamond. My wife was she was a nurse and she was freaked out I couldn't get up. I couldn't stand up she back this Camry on the Knoll of the grassy areas at every both lifters at the time. So she was easily put my arms around her neck. She got the backseat of car that the window. I smelled horrible shit and I had to start a lot of his November in San Diego from sitting to Jack him about his car and she was terrified to get the doctor me to the doctor. Touches take me home to look in the second story or the second deck of this apartment complex in in San Diego. I got to the first deck so I can I get a card I can stand up but with my arms are just leaving downtown we go pass out got to the second. I got to the first deck went down just going to stand up anymore. Got to run her neck worked at my way up the railing on Deck again walk to the kitchen area, which is right in the front door. I was laying in the poncho liner trap was everywhere. I managed to help me manage to get into the into the tub and it's like dirt was coming out of my penis just looked horrible. It's just a ghost in the world is worst pain. I can ever ever ever be in my life and the craziest thing I tell you story because right now I'm not sadistic. I'm not crazy. You may think that they might they may want to put a title on me after hearing me because it makes them feel better. Because you think while he's got must be some special or just fucked up crazy. Dude know I'm a guy that came from nothing anybody's capable of doing shit like this anybody and I sat in that tub. She's put the water on me to call my mom up. My mom was dating a doctor at the time the doctor that I can send you get him to a hospital now she came back in. All I want to do is call Chris kostman the phone the restrictor valve Waterside fucking did it. So she something to doctor said no, let me sit here enjoy this pain. She said what are you talkin about? I said you don't I go. I need to go to doctor. I realize that but I never thought It was humanly possible to do what I did. I went 70 miles at 70 miles. I was dead. I was at 100% but I thought I thought was 100% 3031 more miles after being in the worst physical shape I've ever been in my life at all that all that pain and suffering and things going to my fucking body and I sat in that tub and into Wireless hit me. It was a most amazing feeling of accomplishment and I want to be numb. I want people to give me drugs in the in the numbness fucking pain. 
========,9,title.
I wanted to I did this over it as a crazy as it sounds it was a most amazing moment of my entire life to overcome such to come from this kid. Who is Miss Lee thorsten stuff was tortured. It's our to this kid just guy now who is able to overcome such a amazing pause and obstacles. Call Chris consummate the race director a bad water and he said the idea of a 24-hour races2run 24-hours. You don't even 19 They put doubt in my mind. He was having a bad water. So a month later or so by mother have let him with his race car that hurt 100 200 mile race in Hawaii. 26,000 feet of car is he said that's why I said it's so crazy. I mean, he's a hardcore dude, and he said he might let you win keep enough. My mom is a man I got to do more. So I was broken. I was broken bad and like how long does it take you to recover physically the funny thing about this out to the store very often I had signed up for. I'm getting to that answer is right now. When deployment and me and my wife my mom signed up for the first Las Vegas Marathon down the strip of Las Vegas. And the incident happened so I ran a hundred miles before I ran a marathon two weeks later, roughly December 5th. Was this Marathon that we all sign up for I couldn't walk. I could not walk. I was fucked up. So ten days or two weeks after this Hundred Mile & 1 race. I did this Marathon December 5th in Las Vegas. I said, you know, it's the first one I can't run. Maybe I can walk with my mom. So I try to go out this look normal around our grassy area San Diego check out the Run laser broke. I said fuck I can't even put jacked can't do shit. So I said maybe I watch you guys do the marathon and I'll trade you guys on whatever I said. I'll try to walk my mom. Sure, if it happened that gun went off 2005 14 days after I broke myself off and I qualify for the Boston Marathon time at 3:08. That's crazy. It was funny. But I know people here says my fucking even when I tell you the story, I dropped and I want a job so many names Google it look it up. I don't give a fuk. I almost seems like I'm making my own story up. It does it almost seems like it to you act. Like I tell if I were to hear somebody black dude from fucking Brazilian song about I just happened this happened three whole weeks Ranger school Red Hood your mouth put my feet but my body is able to tell my story it almost sounds like some made-up shit to Yes. Sounds so crazy is you rent a hundred miles before you ever ran a marathon right? Then you didn't run again at all. And you still qualified for the Boston Marathon. So you ran that 308 right for the first marathon you ever did ever did a 2 weeks after you rent a hundred miles right with no training and nothing in between butt gets better than that. You can see my training log taxi posted up. So that's when I started training. For the heart 100. So basically what happened was after that I had about 4 weeks. What does it feel like to run that 308 if you could barely walk when that going off something off in my head and I didn't feel that much pain at all. Afterwards I did but something happened where I was like the gun went off and that thing came back like alright, man. What if I want to call FICA Boston that was my goal, but I was I was jacked up, you know, and I know and I didn't run as much as I should have at all over my Iraq training I hit the weights and but my job, but my goal wasn't to sign up for the year early. I would have qualified for boss was at 3 1059 and I was like what if you can qualify for Boston management have to help me out ice 101 miles. What the fuck is 26 miles to me now, so the mindset going into was Iran 75 more miles in this so I use it to my advantage. So after that happened I ran my feet pretty much broke out. I'll go to the physical therapist, and they had those compression tape compression tape help cuz I'm my people pretty bad off and I would run seventy eighty Hundred Mile weeks, and then I went to the heart 100 race in Hawaii 26,000 feet of climbing over a hundred miles of top 5 hardest hundred mile race has the world. I would even a real Runner. I bake a lot of miles by the last the last two-and-a-half about two months. I want to run it with out there and got through the race didn't 33 hours with a nice place finisher. Not many people finished at that year, and I qualify for bad water got in and I went on to lose weight and train hard and I got V my first year and what about my second year and got there when you see you. You lost weight. Like what will you eventually way in so I went to the race about 190 G. I lost quite a bit bodybuilding time. That's over short. Of time. How did you lose all that way? Once again, I I just worked out hard. I stop taking my protein so much I got off. I was on this stuff called nitro-tech and I got all the protein stuff. I started stop hitting the weights so hard and I just became a running fool peak in the Black Forest Gump man. Pretty much pretty simple man. That's what happened. And when you say you were using compression tape on your feet that your feet were jacked up. What was the extent of the injuries so basically because of my pronation I never figured out cuz my soul has muscles. I always had issues with stress fracture shin splints. So I put a lot of pressure on the inside of my ankles it so that there's just tending that goes up the back side of your don't know if it's get your fibula my backside that that little bone of Exile your foot. It goes right beside that lot right alongside that bone and that thing was just so flared up on both sides that even if Lexie my foot was just killing me. So I realize when you can you know, when you cast That Thing Up Kathy my feet always help me out cuz it it it locked my foot into a position that would have been promoted as much so between the casting of that and it was the a bad water video of 2006. You see me crossing the Finish Line with this compression tape literally like flying on my ankles because I went to the race with compression tape on my ankles. and so basically I have bad on my on my ankles. I had inserts in my in my shoes and also this wedge on the back heel of my left foot so that it would keep me from pronating that he'll so much at all that on just to go run and I ran my ass off and make the badwater 2006 and How much are compressed take my mind feeding walked a lot but I got third place to do you always run with regular running shoes. I do you have some now. I don't have those issues anymore. All this Treasure Chest open my body up to where it happened or how it should have been smiling. Lyman is pretty good, but not perfect. So now I should run in Bradley running shoes. Now, you know, no more compression tape none of that stuff. So if you see now if you see the compressed air in your see my ex-wife here in a second taking the compression tape off of me should join the right now see here right now. She said tape to tape where every day of my life to run while so as you see your story, maybe he kind of unbelievable but there's some proof right there. So that's not what I see as you see right now. We're trying to get a man. I'm free. Just do it right there. What is the most amount of miles you have a run at one time. 5 and 39 hours non stop? Yeah, I've had quite a few people on quite a few people now over the last year so that have run Ultras Courtney dauwalter. You know, she is she won the Moab heard about her. Yes. She should beat all the men by 22 Mi some way that some crazy things. She was first place winner should be everybody else and with her and you would never believe it when you talk to her. She seemed so normal she drinks beer and eats nachos and eats can decide what you want a man. She's just silly and she's fun and does no demon. They're not waiting to meet a demon but you know, I'm like, what is your Daemon for I call you getting through that are demons a quiet demon write it sits there. It has to be something there has to be some of the people that everybody I know that that can do that as a demon the loudest I would admit the shit. Yeah. We got them a hundred percent has to be so when you do this and You you qualify and you you do that race in Hawaii, right? They just let you in after that. 
========,9,title.
No, so the race in Hawaii. Yeah, I threw up and it went like a big time like I did have 100 mile race. I believe that I had and she don't 100-mile you did the Boston Marathon. You did the Vegas Marathon. Yes. I did a hundred miles a hundred miles to Vegas Marathon with the heart 100. Did that hundred Miler at all? This is in a very short amount of time November was the first of December was the 26 mile and not in Las Vegas. January was the next hundred miles and Hawaii a fucking crazy. That is like see if I was your friend that called you up on October 20th, I go. Hey man, how many times you run my race schedule for 2017 pull up David Goggins race results. You can see some real crazy second. They say this is good sense. But just look at the dates of these races and we're going to show it to your second. It's if just look at the hundred miles and 50 miles back-to-back weekends. How many week is it worth between races? So if you look right here if you can't really see it. Look at 2007. Yeah, go all the way down. Keep on going to have to 70 horse races are to get right there. So how's your mother Hawaii flower of the month later? They looking at 14 days later another 50k 50-miler month later. They look at less than a month. Another 50 miler 53 miler in june-july was another hundred miles by water was literally artist that what it was a month after I did that hundred miles a hundred twenty-five My Level was less than a month after that water. The play 100 was 3 weeks after Leadville Angels Crest was to attend date a week after that. I was your mother the bear 100 113 days after that much at mylar sheets and then I ran the 200s a torrent 3.5 but I did Ranch what is 25 miles around there? But what's not in there? Was that McNaughton race I didn't do that so that her and 50 mile race also didn't 2007 that wasn't listed. So that was just my 2007 year. That's insane. Yeah, so do you think that is what fuck your body up? No, no. No, I still run the same mileage now left my body up as hell week. Really? Oh, yeah, so I was so what happened when I realized that my body is really jacked up was I went I was a big-time squatter laws of squatting and I went through the first hell week got messed up so I can have a Callaway Through The Gallery at 3, and I thought I would be it be that guy died on Thursday and then the whole weekend and I graduated pulmonary edema. It was a code name of John stop it cold as fuck hell week. The Pacific Ocean never warm and it rained the whole time. The whole time is rain and he pretty much is Amazon fluid pretty much we were in the pool During the Revolution. He's sunk to the bottom now. I'm his temperature was hot. He missed a lot of hell week for getting pulled out four different stuff. He went to quit and heating up. I know we but yeah. So anyway after hell week ended I want to go back to the gym and also second phase happened. I face like I can get back in the gym. So Jack in the weight, I love Jack and wait and I realized I couldn't squat. Show me from squatting a lot. So I could even squat the bar. Can my lower back is all fucked up. I was like, I don't know what's going on. It was cuz this this muscle so it hell week your hip flexors are so I went through so many of them so fast and so the hardest part of buds, I went through three times. Not not the hell we part that's where the hardest part but it was the initial part of the with everybody sees on TV the log PT the surf torture the daggone boats overhead lat all that shit. I went to that person three times in one year. And all over pretty time my hip flexors got so tight that is Jack me up in Jack me up from my hip flexor so always being so cold and so stressed out and everything lit up to it. But this really was the part that I noticed I can squat Before He'll week or before my first time going to buds after after buds. Volume or do you just think it might just be because your body was exhausted cuz I for 12 years and I will go back and tough it out. Like Michael Joe Burns. He was quite I said fuck I want to go out with Joe Burns, but I just couldn't squat cuz that that muscle is attached to your T12. So what was it doing to is it locking up or suspicious pulling so it made my hips feel like I can't sync my ass incredible pain and then with the weight pushing me down and then try to push up the pain was just as is too much. So it's all this all range of motion power ranger morphin issues. Yeah, that's important thing for my friend. Cam Hanes. It doesn't stretch. He's another friend of mine who runs Ultra races here and that Moab 240. He's run the Bigfoot 205 is one a few of those right? I know he's listening go stretch, dude, they ask for it man. It was specially if you working that hard, right if you're doing that much you had your death to lock a note make it barely touches toes and I thought I could think that's not good bro know it comes back to hurt you inside pretty soon. How flexible you now cuz I would imagine you probably a fucking ballerina at this point because I'm trying to get there. I'm trying to get there. So I stretch every night for these two hours does a thing two people said that it always piss me off like that cuz I'm pretty flexible. They say, oh, you're naturally flexible people have a natural threshold like no they don't like the doctor told me that I know you don't know what you're talkin about. I make you don't know what you talk about because most people don't push themselves past that painted that stretching pain right people want to put a title on UMass easy for them. Exactly people built like Champs on usually flexible. You have to have to force yourself to do this. Right and I know it because I had a friend my friend. Timer dog know he was a football player Jack big thick dude. Terrible flexibility was taking taekwondo with me and over the course of a couple years. I saw that dude eventually develop a full split it Go and it just did it through his mind. Yes was everybody else is done training that guy would be on the mat constantly stretching always working out cuz he had built his body up. So strong all those years of squatting and lift and could help that he just know he's all tense and then he was just like this super powerful, right but all a very tense. That's why I thought I never stretch cuz I wanted that strength that tight muscle but no, I don't think it is stupid. But I think you're not supposed to stretch before you do big physical activities because I think it does like we can use someone but I don't think being flexible overall makes you weak or not at all in for martial arts because you need that flexibility to have leg dexterity to be able to kick right. It's got to be fluid where it's not tightened up like a restriction of the motion of your body. I get its truth. I just think For whatever reason and I'm up. I'm one of those drone on too much about yoga. I'm like one of those vegans. It's like you got to do it man. I just tried and Christian or something. So I'm getting that way now man. I'm getting that way now for anybody does anything the hard like, you know, if she'd do anything like weightlifting type shed or martial arts type shyt where it's just everything's explosion. It's lifting heavy push-push-push yoga Just Bounce your shit out and we'll all these people that resisted like there was some article recently that was something along the lines of hot. Yoga is just trending on since I read that and then even in the article talked about that there might be some benefits and terms of like the strengthening your arteries and they didn't even mention heat shock proteins is a study going on right now. I believe it's at Harvard. One of my friends was telling me about it where there they're trying to find the benefits of 90 minute hot yoga class. Cuz I think it might me or the observe benefits of sauna was they already know for a fact has big benefits because of your body producing heat shock proteins to do with the heat, that song in here man, I go in that fucker all the time when no one can tell me doesn't work unless big is proof positive change my life. It was stretching yoga stretching all that stuff behind change it but I just think it balances out your body and those static poses. We just holding them hoes and it just did and it works you out in a weird way that you just don't get lifting weights or hitting the bag or anything that uses not going to get that that kind of working out. I can't agree with you more so difficult that is all right with your ass off you reject that stuff Housewives and shit and you like this is like the silent struggle assembly. Did nobody knows it's like if you see like two doorways, right and one of them is like fucking CT Ali Fletcher fucking Super Pump iron addicts gym. Which is hard work and right next to it is the yoga studio you like. Well, once you get done with all that hard work, you'll go over to that yoga studio notice two different kinds of hard work going on two different kinds of hard work and Sir.

So what do you do now in terms of like you got over this? Five years ago you were in this bad situation with your body's not working right now. Everything's working. Great again. I had two heart surgeries also, so, you know, it was just so you know, you're not supposed to have a hole in your heart be a seal and it was born with it. I was born with it and they pushing so hard so it in 2009 Austrian fish Race Across America and I just couldn't go anymore another Pitfall of my life with the hole and out people's off active duty seal for three years. I had two hearts that have been trying to fix it till the whole were significantly large or how big they say it was as big as a quarter and like how the hell is a big is a quarter. That's that's a pretty big hole in your heart cuz they had to Helix patches. I'm like that's impossible that the Helix patches that I'm a heart. So the two stents. What is the Helix patch? It is like a little mesh very like what they do for hernias. Look something like me something like that. Small artery Play Dispatch, but they go through your arteries with a camera to buy for Audrey went to my heart they went and they took the Helix patch that they play sit in there and then they found out sickness later at the hole wasn't covered up enough. You can always this. I mean in the Hills pass was very damn big to hit you later put on going to go back in there in 2010. How does the patch adhere to your heart? I guess your heart heals around the patch to but how did they stick it in place? I guess they put it with the holes at or wha and then it kind of like inflates the whole is that goes in there? And then it kind of cover the hole in the heart. So there's two things in my heart right now that the hardest kind of covered up an image of it for us. Wow.So it's attached to this little probe right? And then they put it over the area where the injury is.Wow, that's insane the atrial septal defect if I had extra septal defect. So basic everything I've done I down. From medicine. It's crazy on you do have you done that's so crazy. They could do that solves out for us off a cutie for three years. So I stuck. I was in a recruiting area for 3 years trying to get back on active duty. And that's does that was my life for three years. So they put that patch in. Yep. And now your hearts 100% It's 100% So 1% Wow, I was at losing your blood and I was just I was at that off. It's just amazing that you were able to do all that with a hole in your heart. That's what the doctors are saying the other cuz they know how to seal. So I went in and the doctor that found the whole game EKGs all the stuff once again after I ran like the 205 miles, you know.Jacked up. So the doctor. Shrek is Aki no game because you go to the doctor get an echocardiogram. So I'm in there an echocardiogram just chilling out in there and the guy talking to me has a little one in my heart for bulshit about stuff and he when people get quiet what's going on? And he says I'll be right back. He goes and gets a doctor doctor comes in first thing. I'm a heart. doctor gets another doctor Now I'm just freaking the fuck out. I'm like, okay, cuz we come to your heart when I was big deal. So they come back in and say hey we can stop the echo cardiogram me talk to you at the hallway. You have a hole in your heart and the guy didn't know that I was he was maybe God all things as a CEO cuz I'm a black guys are seals and you had a conversation about you know, we got fixed this real quick. I said, yeah, I mean how to seal he said you could have died jumping you can skydive in you could have died in all this stuff is basically the hole in your heart if it gets plugged with something like anything like you don't listen to get a bubble from diving or something like that because I run so I called luck. I called look. Wow, so I I got through two surgeries that way back on. I lost the give you the first one and then how about when do they realize it's not. Not good enough. Should I take you back when you get a bubble study a bubble test, so it's so that they like their lease in bubbles that way. Safe bubbles that way to see if the bubble goes through your heart so they have this echocardiogram again and they hook you up. I think to Ivy or something like that and they throw these bubbles through your heart and they see if it goes through after 6 months when I should have been healed up the bubble went through. Say hi to tell me where Dan hey we got to you know, you're not you're not good to go. So I had to take a year before I have another surgery because my dad Patchen to be completely completely healed so it didn't go to all this time. 
========,9,title.
You knew you had a hole right? So so they do at a hold because of the heart surgery might be all this time. Like when you're waiting for, you know, you have an extra hole. Yes. I do have a whole allowed to do with your body then we'll at that time that go you don't do how you feel comfortable. And so, you know that the whole is not going to kill you right now, but you can't. You can't jump you too much want to see you anymore songs recruiter for a. Of time. So basically I was crazy about that is before my second surgery. I was actually training for Delta Force. I want to go to Delta and I was rucking Ruck running a lot. And before my second Rock Running me you run with a pack and a pack of my back was away on how heavy is it back 50 60 lb and you run with that on your supposed to hike or Humpback Rock hopping I ran with it because I wouldn't cuz you know, that's what I did. So the day before the day of the day of heart surgery. I did a Ruck run. She's sick. I knew I was out of commission for a while. So fuck it better get my last one in dude Jesus Christ so I could do I have not have my training logs after my second heart surgery. All I could do was walk. So I became a vulture Walker. Why won't my fucking ass off and ice over pretty time it took a year for that thing to heal up and heal you help my first Bible study at the resting heart surgery came back negative or positive the bubble with through again or no, and they're going to crack me open that. Time my heart healed around that thing nicely and I passed the second level test. So the first bubble test was how long after a year who is so the first bubble test after the first surgery for 6 months and then you had to go through a full six months after that right totally heal, then you're the second heart surgery. And when does the bubble test fail after the second heart surgery? It was about six months Jesus Christ, you know, I'm sorry to inform you that we have to crack your chest open the next time I'm going to get in there be a third heart surgery. Is there an app that one? They said we have to wait for 6 months to see if it's things going to close up right? Then. I came back like a man about to get crack the fuck open in that bubble. Got pinned up man. Maybe force it through your mind. I know right. It's out when you visualize. That's it. That's something to visualize holyshit man. That is crazy. It's crazy. When a Ruck run with a hole in your heart too. But I did it for several years as a fuck it come out to keep on going man. That's amazing. After all said and done. Everything is good now. Yeah, everything's I mean, I'm sure it's about to pop up in my fucking ass not to do that. You know, everything is good right now. I'm always waiting for the next thing to pop up and I have the same way. I saw I was attacked it. But yeah, is it right now in the best shape? My 43 years old just turned forty-three, February 17th. I am in the best shape my life. I'm not knocking on wood because life bucket life comes out two dudes. All right, if I came knocking on wood come at me. I mean, I would think that you would be a go-to guy for injuries. Like if anybody's I've had them all broke the world record for chin UPS in you rip, your arm apart pull-ups ass, if you pull up the picture measures a picture of my hand you'll see I don't know. 
========,9,title.
What is it pull ups or Sepulchre hands and chin-ups our hands full for so I feel three-time fell twice before. I finally got it that there are time and The first time I ripped the shit out of my forearm and then the second time you'll see there's a picture of my hand and it is a third degree burn. So that's my hand. Oh Jesus man. What in the fuck is going to look in your bit by a wolf? So what's funny about that as you see that that doesn't create after one pull up so you can imagine the pain of cuz I know you have one contact Point that's it like running you can overcome it cuz it was big giant legs and front. It's different when you have these little fragile punk-ass hands touching the bar imagine 4030 pull up. So many times you're coming on that bar coming off that way toward the seven pounds at the time. I was a bigger guy. I'm at 19055 now. Supposed to tell 22 pounds heavier. So I was a lot bigger than I am right there. Damn. You look pretty sick get that shit, man. So you were doing it in sets of 5 chapter 5, so Did you see I have these different people who are witnessing. You you have to have your your your number there to make sure that you're you know qualify for the guest of the world's record. That's 1450 Avalon way to Governor the 4015 pull-ups to go Heart of Jesus Christ. So yeah, and how long did you do this over 24 hours if it was 7:17. Wow. What does it feel like in the last chin-up? You know what actually is a video that we have and I was chasing this guy named Steven Highland. So it's getting Stephen Hahn had the record and the video isn't my last three pills for broke the record. I'm talking so much shit this never fucker. I'm like a motherfuker you thought I was going to get it, huh? I told you bitch ass mother fucker. I'm coming after you I'm here. Now. We talking shit. It's a cool video, but I felt I felt nothing. I was just happy I have to do I just 67,000 pull-ups in 9 months. And the failures I did the first time in September failed. Miserably I was a day should the 2588 or something like that to people too much later November tried again failed again too much later in January 19th. I finally fucking got it. So after I got it wasn't like I'm happy cuz I can get you more fucking pull-ups anymore Rodger that salt was and if I can check that off now but I like doing what she can get some get get me or knock some out you don't like doing them. So you got to do them if that's my whole life is like someone someone gets drunk at a certain whiskey like you if they smell it they'll get disgusted like it's like Jagermeister something like that and they smell it right. Is that what it's like with you with chin ups with Billups with a lot of the lot of things. My life so it's the reason why I just don't like running man. It hurts is brutal. It sucks going out and I will be gone for 2 hours or an hour's the fuck. I'm not crazy man. It's just sucks. I mean, you know people put me in this category of you must be some crazy guy who loves it. Man. That's why I do it though. That's the only way to callus your fucking brain man won't make it hard in my people take these classes on mental toughness or even seal to the class about this Jose since Upptalk elephant one bite at a time breathing control by Rodger that you got to put yourself in a laser situation. It's a lifestyle. How are you going to react how you're going to react to it that all that training without the fucking door when you're in a fucking cold water and your fucking miserable is the first hour of 130 hours of Hell Week in that first wave goes over your head and your the coldest you've been in your life and your mind goes from our $1 one fucking 30. Stop talking shit dude you a thing about these about getting a fuck out of here. But if you live this shit on a daily basis, you know how to calm your mind down to self talk will help all that stuff for help. But usually we react we have pain we have supper will react and react about get the fuck out of here. We got to go. It's those people able to control that fucking feeling a fucking flight is a normal fucker. There's a way through this is not going to be your forever. I'm not cold right now. I went to three of them. I'm not cold now. I'm in a nice warm to deal with you. You got to think about that shit just go to the end, but we don't know that we don't think that at that time of this will last forever and then you get to sit back on Friday there by walking across the you know back on the grinder all the 16th 17th & guy that graduated we need a chance to watch these guys Victorious and then you get a chance to think about that you take that hot warm shower. Birthday comes your fucking mind. Why the fuck did I quit? So what keeps me going. I've quit several things. I know what's on the backend fucking quitting. It's a lifetime of thinking about why the fuck did I do that? And I fucking doing that this something about talking to a guy like you that a lot of people hope that you're going to say some magic thing that's going to click in their brain. Everybody gets change who they are. Like, what is it? What is the thing? That's why people go to these self-help conferences and they take these classes and they hope that someone's going to say something and it changes the way their mind works.

It's hilarious to me it is it's kind of lyrics to me too, but would it what is also hilarious is that what you're saying is that you have to do those things you have to suffer you have to live in it. You have to be comfortable in it. And then maybe some of that ship will help you a little bit along the way. And I went to I was now the seal recruiter I got invited to a mighty smart ass motherfuckers there man. I'm not that I'm a cigarette and Dumber knuckle dragger. There was this guy that I forget his name and he was like the top head head guy old white guy, you know all all genius doubt and we're on this panel and they were asking us all these questions about the Mind mental toughness and she was answering him. I was answering any questions. I'll never forget. He was his answer them off of theory. He never put his fucking ass and shit. You got a bunch of fucking books and you think that you know, how the fucking mind works and should I going through hell just a kid and then all the way up until now running so I know that theory is bullshit. Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff out there you can read from people but I lived help at when you put yourself in hell. That's the only time you can figure out how to fuck to get through that motherfucker. You can't you can't read somebody else's book about some Theory how to do shit some guy who set up in there nice warm office and rat MMOs some book with nice cup of coffee in the fucking hang up. I want to see that guy. Worst himself in fucking hell and he thought about quitting and leaving it in his wife and his kids and why am I here? Is it is it worth it all this crazy shit and still said it found out a way to get through it. So basically that's that's the bottom line of it all we all want to read about how we can quickly get somewhere. That's why the six minute abs and also so powerful you make it some results from it, but not permanent. The permanent result comes from you fucking I say it all the time you have to suffer. You have to make that a tattoo on your fucking brain. So that hard time comes again. You don't forget it. You may forget it for a second, but you can go back in the cookie jar call. It's a it's something that we've all endured. I called the cookie jar and we often forget how hard we are. But you got to reflect back to pick up reflect up a ventilator been through that and then remind yourself. I'm a bad motherfuker. And then you can get you that shit, but if you don't believe it, you have an indoor shit. You're just blowing smoke man ain't nothing to get to anything. What was this guy saying? What series was about I forget exactly it was but it's not about what what the Mind does under stress. And how we can't he said how we can't do something and I did it. I did what he said we couldn't do it. What was he saying? He couldn't do it was somebody if you're born. If you're born a certain way somebody if you're born a certain way, you can't become this way. It was totally saying that would who I am now, like I had to be born with some not genetic power or some some gift from God that I had to have some kind of special gift that has some kind of special do not forget what set me off but was that we had to be to to to be somewhere you had to be born with it. What was the concept and I know what I was born with and I know the battle that I had in my mind, so when he said it I sat there looking up in some of the crowd ask me a question. I totally contradicted everything you said I was like nah, man, I mean I fucking know for a fact that you can be this fucked up dude really fucked-up dude, and with the right mindset and it is it is it sound so easy with the right mindset doesn't sound easy. Simplistic answer you can you can but you have to go into a dark chambers that we often shut off and you got to open in Lafayette open up at 5 that fucking demon get in there talk to that mother fucker say what's up, and we often take the we all like to take the spoiling Highway the easy Highway has has fucking signs that has restaurants with all of that for the highway. We always step over the shovel. And all I did was I pick up that fucking shovel that shovel. I made my own path and you may have big boulders and shit. They need to get in Torrance in miles of the road faster than you but going through this path of Life The Journey over here that you make yourself that's incredibly difficult, but comes out the other end of that motherfucker is some glorious shit that you can't even explain to people and we're afraid Bottom line is most of us even the people have all these theories and shit. It's easier to accept the fact that I'm just not good enough. I wasn't made to do that. And yes, I'm fucking James, but I'll tell you right now man. We can do a lot of shit when it comes this pure on guts and willpower and getting through shit. We have a lot more with a lot more than we think we have the other problem with a guy like that with his theory is his theories are based on results and those results are based on human beings and most human beings there certain people that are born with certain gifts like a guy like LeBron James eyes physical Talent, you know, Jon Jones MMA obviously physical talent, but there's a When you look at someone who's super successful, you always assume that it has to be because of some sort of physical gifts because people look at themselves and I'm sure this doctor this old dude probably had like a little gut and probably has a key. I looked a little tiny arms was weak shoulders and it probably thought well there certain people that are just mesomorphic and probably broke it down all the scientific terms, you know, they they they just have fast twitch muscle fibers and he'll say all this crazy shit that is true at the very highest levels of the winners, right but it doesn't mean that you can't become that just means it's too painful for most people to go through so very few people ever get there. So if you look at the actual results, he would be correct but he's not correct cuz she doesn't take the shovel exactly. That's not the motor story does not some easy lit up street lights right with nice. Smooth roads, right is a difficult mother fucker where you're going to fail and you could be in your head you can be I'm not good enough and it is how you get through. That is how you get through that on a daily basis when that thing as a man. I'm 43. I've done so much you start to become civilized. The refrigerator gets full you start making money and you start I'm not getting cold anymore. I'm retired what's in at 40 people shouldn't be playing basketball or football or are you start to believe this shit? 
========,9,title.
And it becomes in your fucking mind. Like there's people who are retiring, you know, if 47 years old or 30 something years old at 43. I'm still putting her jemile weeks to do in thousands of pull-ups to thousand push-ups cuz I'm not allowing myself to become civilized the worst didn't happen to a man become civilized. You lose that fucking fight. You you lose that why the fuck am I doing this shit? I'm good. You had good man. You ain't never fucking right and that's his mom and tell her that you may have more but you never fucking a ride. You want to be uncommon amongst? Common People. Uncommon amongst uncommon people's one of the greatest ways to put it back. If if if if you're like for me what got me in trouble with the Navy Seals if I want to be one so bad so bad. I thought my ass off that's on the sun Common People very uncommon, but once you become a Navy SEAL, you are Navy Seals. So guess what happened your fucking comment again? I want to be uncommon amongst uncommon people. I wanted to be the guy I don't care if you fucking light and I'll give you understand me. I don't give a fuk once I went to this fucking join his path of life. You ain't got a whole bunch of fucking guys that don't fucking like me. I don't give a fuck. I'm a warrior. There's like I've been in a lot more combat Than Me A Warrior's not always at war is a mother fucker. He says I'm here again. Today. I'm here again tomorrow going to be here the next day. I'm 50 years old and still function after it's a personal personal fucking limit on what's possible and that's what got me in trouble. That's why I went to Ranger school as a seal. That's why I try to go to Delta Force twice. You know why I've been I've been through all these different training programs that I was looking for in the military without sound. In the training these people get their ass handed to him after they get out a lot of them get civilized. I always wanted to go back in the training. Am I where I was at I want to go back to war in the war was in that training program where you see guys you can quit guys who are brutal guys who are suffering guys were you ghost as a seal? You don't volunteer for Ranger school? I did I put in 7 chicks got turned down by Astrid getting your got accepted. I went at 28 29 years old and they go why did you go so I started becoming civilized? I thought of becoming complacent. I need to get my fucking ass chick to get in when you go at the seal Goin Down to it. You have no rank in Ranger school. You can be a major. You're just fucking Joe Brown You're Nobody and you're not eating you're not sleeping. So I always put my voice myself and shit like that. Even I will climb the ladder. Got it, officially fall back down that motherfucker Inside Man getting soft dude getting soft. Kick your fucking ass again and I can get off this kind of process. Did you find resistance from that amongst other guys that didn't like to make that you were making them uncomfortable because that is something that people there's a natural instinct that people have when someone's working harder than them to diminish that person. Well, I know that a lot of guys, I want me for a lot of reasons and I realize that I am a guy that doesn't care if you like me or not and when you're alpha male and you're against other off of males and we eat our own alpha males eat their own. I love that shitt Smoking go man. I want to eat it at a man. I'm all about that kind of mentality, but I would sometimes take it to another level. What part of a of a good old boy Network? I don't want people I want to be David fucking God is the word for too long in my life and it got me in trouble for trauma left. I want to be accepted growing up. I lied I fucking do what I could for it. If you fucking like UFC and I did it. I love it. I love it. Magical fuckerwatch. May be my friend be my buddy that fucking we cash it. I found out through this path of Life. Who is David Goggins.

Who am I to go to alone? It was a fucking trophy on the fucking wall the mantle that Chuck is my fucking brain. No one helped me get to know my pay my fucking bill know what that shitt from. You don't know where man was fucking mouth the fucking way with you. I suffered on my own and developed this man who said who I am, man. Very competitive ultra-competitive do that. Take it what you want man, you're all that personal sovereignty exactly was not a lot of people that have that that's me and just a lot of people that change who they are depending upon what people want from them. And that's that's me that's important man and most people struggle their whole life to find out who they are struggle there hold their whole life to find out what defines them what they actually enjoying what they don't you start putting yourself in situations that suck your find yourself. Yeah, you find it real quick. That is the thing. Right? And that's one of things that I've gotten from paying attention to you is that you what you're preaching what you're talking about is finding yourself through struggle. Is it yourself? What do you find out? If you like to swim that's all you want to do is swim. What are you finding out? Put the people talk about triple down on your fucking strikes. That's the fucking we cash it in the world triple down your fucking weaknesses find out something about yourself the goodshit you another happy shit. That's why I might on my face because I don't you talk about good times. I got to get you as happy as I want to tell you how you can help yourself get through the times that suck real life. This is real life. 90% of your life will suck. 10% will be fucking happy. You may be lucky guy and have a lot of fucking money have a great ass woman. All that shit. Trust me one-on-one with that fucking guy. He's missing something cuz life still sucks that you had to face something that bothered him so fucking life. Show me still eating that motherfucker up almost everybody everybody the fuck up, but maybe you found a good way how I did Growing Up and how to ignore that voice as saying you ain't facing some shit. I'm not special. I just stopped listening to that voice. So do you believe in God you cuss so much. When I say fuck is it is it that you know what I'm thinking if I try to make it all pretty and shit, that's not what my life was. It was a violet Violet trouble daily to get where I'm at today. I'm not going to water down like a watered-down. She wasn't fun game fun today. I'm happy don't you think that your happiness is probably elevated by the amount of pain that you've gone through 100% So the amount of suffering that you understand the amount of pain that you've gone through makes you appreciate the happiness and the Beautiful Moments with much more intensity. That's what week people miss about. My story meet people here this soft kid on my God. You must be measurable. Oh my God, what the hell is wrong with them? You're missing the fucking story. You're not listening to the story man. Look what I overcame if that is a put some badge of honor tattooed in your fucking brain for the rest of your life. You can die today talking to Joe Rogan commission the story man. Am I happy? What the fuck do you think don't miss? It? Don't misunderstand the passion which I speak for not being intensely. Happy happiest person in the world, but I'm not done so I can speak to you like old man. Everything is great. I have a lot more shit to do not wash it to do with this is in the same use of the word that you used the Warrior's mentality the Warriors like right this is this is the way that you can keep balanced and saying right and and keep a good grip on who you are.

And here's a quote that was said, I don't know who said it was a great quote this guy said Going to combat going to war by the hundred men that go on the war tension. You fucking be there 80 of them are just targets 10 do most or nine do most of fighting. What is a warrior? And it's a true quote to life. I saw it going to train. I saw it everywhere. I went there. So many people that show up to life that shouldn't even fucking be around and do people do all the work. I want to be part at 9 that I am working towards being that one and that's just how I live my life know. What are you doing with your life these days right now? I keep the same. I'm very routine. I get very morn. I run I go to the gym and then at night time I stretch out. I am just trying to develop a business card to me a lot of money trying to do that. I'm just getting out. I'm a I'm an introvert. So I never to get on social media. I'm not big on that. I'm big on being Make yourself, I believe all these. Fucking cameras and phones and shit if it takes you away from the most powerful thing in the world, which is your fucking mind. So I try hard to continue to grow that I'm I'm trying to break a record again. I'm trying to cross Death Valley as fast as possible top of Mount Whitney and costly trying to put those in for me but the biggest thing I'm trying to find more of myself and all I can find more is a silenced the world out as much as I can because this is just getting busier every day is getting faster and faster gets the more you are missing who the fuck you are. So I trap my own mind a lot. So it look man I put my phone away I push it away and I go dark I go dark a lot and it's because I have to find out I want to join your life and we all have a different Journey that I want to be in my fucking pine box and I believe your spirit lives forever has to fucking powerful. No way in hell that thing is dies when you die. What a beautiful look back on my life in the mall, Dedham you so fuckin problem myself forever. This is all temporary shit to me. I want to be forever proud of who I was a man and change who I used to be the liar. The insecure guy the guy who can whatever I want to be proud. And if I die now if I die Ava. 901 look at myself and see myself don't you think that also like we were saying that because you've gone through so much struggle you appreciate happiness true happiness. Do you think that you appreciate discipline because you weren't disciplined. Do you think you appreciate the hard work you put in because you used to be weak. Yes. I appreciate self-discipline. Yes, I never had in the crazy thing about what you know, you say that I have a mother fucken wake me up at 3:00 in the freaking morning. So you got your shit in I have no trainer. I have a nutritionist. It was a self discipline that I had to survive can survive I was weak to to to to to thrive. No one said Emmanuel tour 97 lb man I would help you out of your fucking not smart. I'm going to help you out. I had to work at all this shit. I had to overcome and self-discipline is everything if you don't have it. I look at you right now. I know you're capable of more. It's not discipline so much for me. It's all on you. It's all on you the self part. It was big. We need someone to hold people accountable. Fuck that shit man. Fuck that. Should we recount on people too much to get us through shit and we look to her right route to our left looking for help. And if you can build that self you can do it that total accountability in oneself. It's not about being selfish. I'm trying to create a better me. So hopefully people were here in this or taking it the right way can say I can run a mile babe. I'm going to 215 fucking miles June 4th. I was being a silly about all that shit. She doesn't matter. I want you to see how fucking far you can go and I saw us about yourself and that's what all comes from. I guarantee you've already done that what you experience from watching a television show. And with what got you out the door would got you to sort of take the first step to change your life. What you experienced by Watch Rocky. Would you expect those those moments of inspiration? Those are critical for people they need to know that someone's done something that someone's done something that's greater than they would they can imagine themselves doing and they want to take a step towards trying to be better.... Inspirations gigantic and sometimes it comes across as corny, you know, people read is too much of it online if he get becomes a drowns out if you lose it the meaning gets lost mean there's a n is a lot of posers is a lot of people out there that are pretending that Trying to offer up inspiration or a true honest account of their experiences. But really what they're trying to do is say something that's going to get likes right now. They're trying to say things that they think people going to go. Yeah double high-five, right? You know, there's a thing that people are doing when they're just trying to just get social cred. Right right facial picture of my fucking real life. Like it or not man, but that brought that real life is fuel for people rides fuel for me. I mean, I thought I loved that shitt I live off of it. There's a lot of people that I follow online and you're one of them that I can get something out of that. I could watch a short clip of Utah gun show clips of this podcast people going to play these clips go for fucking crazy runs after work, so well, hope so fuck. Yeah, they're not so you don't even have to hope it's going to happen. That's good.

What is this business you doing? What is my own Goggins loc, basically? I am invested in myself. I'm invested in myself. And I hope that this story is can change somebody's life not to be me cuz they ain't bout me. And I and I I try to be as real as I can because we're all fucking suffering in this world were all hurting and I tried to take away all titles. You want to give me that you know that I did not come from that shit that's right to be so authentic and so real about my own insecurities my own fault this being fucked up person. I'm not the best at anything. I'm not I'm not gifted. I'm just driven and it's all about trying to share that message with people is all about, you know, I speak to a lot of people and that's what do I do now? And how are you doing in this business? I do some motivational speaking, but you know right now I'm not rich. I make a lot of fucking money. I'm just trying to build the brand of authentic as possible because I don't want to build it. Too fast, My biggest fear in life is people can be right through a motherfuker. That's not real. I do it all the time like a lot you have these great quotes and I ain't in it and they Mass produce. I can't master do something man. And they have these great quotes and shit. But are you live in that mother fucker what you just quoted and how powerful it may sound. Are you getting up every for good morning? Am I working out? Whatever. Are you really getting the fuck? After are you just talkin to motivate people Brian and I don't want to be that guy or you talkin to pretend that you're exactly make this big money over here to decide which Robin make a lot and they they they talked as shit and they're off this until it's gone Sky Boutique bullshit bullshit man fucking wake up get after it live what you're saying, and then it comes people can see what I talked to her. Talk so fucking Dispassionate cuz I'm reliving my fucking life. I'm reliving this morning. When I got up I want to do that shit. I'm reliving everything I did and I can't speak to you like all, shit just suck it suck my ass. What am I talkin about? Like after this podcast? You'll see man got you so calm right now. What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm not going back through that shit man. I'm not going back to the the suffering and shitted it took to become who I am today some sort. I do this brand to the point where I can slowly hopefully make people from motivated to driven cuz motivation is scrap shit shit to be motivated go run if it's cold somewhere where they're at a llama for the shut that door go back inside that's motivation. It comes and go as how you feel if you and your wife are good if you and your kids are good if you're good at work, you're motivated. I like a motherfuker whose life is imploded ain't got shit in life and says. Did you forget after today man? So it's about so that's when you moved from motivation to driven to obsessed. And I want people to realize once you get to the portion of it over here at the gym and upset sparked your stop this commitment that you have. The authenticity is one of the reasons why people are connected to what you meant your messages. That's one of the reasons why what you're saying? You don't want to grow up too fast. You don't want it to be bulshit. You're terrified of that thing just like we were talking about was weak people you terrified of seeing that weakness in yourself, right? You know that we all see that we've all seen motivational things that are bullshit. We've all talked to people that are talking and you realize there's nothing really that they're connected to the not really connected to their words the words just a bunch of words, they pieced together cuz they sound like something that someone who's you know enlightened on the subject would say Yeah, it does. It doesn't doesn't connect it all so your struggle now is to try to figure out how to stay you and get the message out but still be fully connected to that message. Right as you know, it is not so much a struggle because I'm not really about I'm not driven by the business. I'm not I'm not doing my trying to be I make a very small salary for being retired from the military. That's all I need. So I'm not fast to I'm a minimalist motherfuker. Give me a backpack a fucking ground asleep on in a pull-up bar in a fucking some running shoes in a Subway sandwich or some shit and I fucking straight. So it's I believe in patience patient dude. I can watch the piece of grass grow for 20 years cuz I know that It is how you get somewhere in life by being that look like mentality and be able to watch something grow very calmly patiently and that's all I'm doing right now. It's not about money. It's about people know me. I'll keep you like me whoever wants to hear. This is out there. It's also your your your goal is to grow this right slowly very slowly and you goes to grow this in order to impact people. That's it is not about me.

What do you get out of impacting people? It's a good question. I don't I don't get anything out of it. I'm going to but you must get something. You must be personal satisfaction. I must be a connection to those people must be it must be enriching to you is hard to connect with people cuz there's a quite a few now. They're coming in. It's it's my duty is my duty to share. My stomach is somebody who discovered a new Earth discovered the people on it in in in in a water source in the food source. I discovered a whole nother part of your fucking brain. A lot of people don't even know about is my job by being a fucking on this journey being the discovery person didn't even the person that discovered this part. I discovered a very important part that I haven't met many people that have discovered. This part is a lot out there. That's my job now to take this week people in the category that I was in and say stop reading the Bullshit stop listening to the bullshit. And if you're my story of success can impact somebody it is my job is my duty to show the door as much as I'm not really fond of it. I'm not going to kind of guy wants to sit in the fucking room in just be me. Just leave me alone by myself. It's who I am about to get uncomfortable and tell people all this shit is needed to get those good tell me about it at a fourth grade reading level high school. I started I lied to people to be there fucking friends. I feel good. It doesn't feel good at all. But maybe somebody's doing the same shit. And maybe they can realize wow that motherfucker was a piece of shit fucking now. Is it a Navy SEAL retired guy and runs his mouth was 297 pounds in Foot Locker in wow in truth. I was a fucking pathetic motherfuker.

My people cannot say that to themselves this we have to choose his great fucking magical words that that makes set that make people feel good. Tell yourself the truth. It's going to cause your fucking fat then maybe bullying you but you might be fucking fat. I called you dumb. It's me, but you might be fucking dumb. Is life man take it for what it's worth and change it and that terrible feeling when someone does tell you they are fat you can use that as fuel. And that's all this is about it and where it goes if it goes somewhere or whatever. I don't give a shit. Will you said something that I think of when I run and it's at most people quit at 40%. 40% real man. I love that quote 40% rule Matt and I am I really develop that to my heart surgery is not developed that to that person get my run is I thought I had given hundred percent. Charity ball 70s Funk. Up. I thought I'd give it a hundred percent and the Goat at last I'll go mad their happiness. I wouldn't even near a hundred percent. Sure. I came up with this thing called the 40% Rule and Stacy where you suck a car you put a governor on a car and they said a car can go 130 that Governor stop the car at 91. I am trying to take him out. When a fucking floor by can't go. I can't go any faster. We do at your brain. We put a governor Branstad me feel pain discomfort suffering all those words that we hate to say cuz we in this happy peaceful world. We live in now we stop we slow down and if you can get through these different barriers and gained 5% 2% 3%. 40% become 60s City protect. You can 70 80 90 and then you'll hopefully one day near a hundred. I don't I don't know people probably at a hundred and we think we're there but there's so much more than a hundred US door though. I love that. I think a true. I think that's 100% true. I think when you were laying in that tub, you knocked on a door that is 100% true. No one is ever get that is on for the truth. I didn't give a hundred percent in that house yet. 1-mile run I did for the first time. So that's the scary thing. That's the scariest thing in the world. I didn't die. You probably gave 99.99999 Brown's Body lies I guarantee I guarantee man. I don't know how to end this any better than that.
